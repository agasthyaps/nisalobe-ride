# One Potential Scenario for the Embedded Practice Model

## Beginning of School Year: Data Analysis and Planning

At the beginning of the school year, a middle school math teacher reviews previous year's data records in addition to the common beginning-of-year assessment data and other observations. Through his own analysis, he determines that one of his sections of seventh grade math does not have the foundational skills necessary to apply multiplication and division strategies with rational numbers. Because he will support his students in his class through the planned curriculum, he has a conversation with his department head (or coach, colleague, administrator, etc.) regarding the findings from his students' BOY data. This conversation supports some of his initial conclusions. He will be evaluated through the embedded practice model as an alternative to the original SLO process. The teacher has targeted and on-going data discussions, as he has always done, with his colleagues and evaluator throughout his practice.

## Early Year: Student Identification and Initial Meeting

Using his available data, he determines the students who need explicit support in the multiplication and division strategies of rational numbers in order to access the general curriculum (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.NS.A.2.C). Early in the year, the teacher meets with his evaluator as part of the regular evaluation cycle to discuss professional practice, professional responsibilities, and student learning. This discussion will include learning expectations for his students to meet the individual needs of each student over the course of the cycle of instruction. The teacher describes how he will approach his students' learning needs differently this year by trying new strategies in the first unit of study, and how he will support this group of students throughout the year. Based on this data discussion, the evaluator and teacher agree this is an appropriate plan of action.

## Mid-Year: Ongoing Instruction and Reflection

Consistent with his normal teaching practice, he collects and reflects upon his students' work and adjusts his instructional practice to meet the students' various needs. He provides on-going feedback, both written and verbal, to his students so that they have an opportunity to reflect on and improve their ability to apply operations to rational numbers. After reviewing the new 3E/3.5 rubric, he notes that to earn a 3 or a 4, he should collect and share his students' reflections. The teacher found that including students in their own goal-setting proved helpful in approaching this first unit of study. During observations and regularly scheduled conferences, the teacher and evaluator continue to share ideas about adjustments to instruction for this particular group.

## Mid-Year Check-In: Progress Review and Data Discussion

Later, at his next check-in with his evaluator, he highlights the progress that all sections of his math classes have made. They also discuss the data which include scored student work samples, his gradebook, and some students' reflections on their own progress. The evaluator and the teacher reflect on the whole-class data sheets to identify trends and reflect on instructional methods that should be sustained, eliminated, and improved upon. The evaluator agrees that the teacher will continue to use these effective strategies to support his students, and follows up with similar data discussions as the year progresses.

## End of Year: Final Conference and Reflection

As part of his preparation for his end-of-year conference, he analyzed the data for his students' scores in math, particularly the section that was an area of focus in the beginning of the year. Recognizing that the final rating is made by the evaluator, the teacher and evaluator reflect on professional practice and responsibilities, as well as student learning using the approved evaluation system rubric(s). They also discuss how the on-going collaborative discussions with evidence of instructional practices help to determine how he will approach differentiating his math instruction in the coming year, as well as opportunities for future professional learning.
