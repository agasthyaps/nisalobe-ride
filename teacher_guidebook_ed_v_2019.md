2     In troduction   Rhode Island is committed   to ensuring that all educators receive fair, accurate, and meaningful  educator evaluations that provide information that can help all teachers improve and refine their  practice. This commitment is an outgrowth of our recognition of the influence teachers  have on student  growth and achievement .    Currently, districts in Rhode Island may submit a district - designed model for  approval that complies with the Educator Evaluation System Standards or adopt  the Rhode Island  Model Teacher Evaluation and Support Syste m (Rhode Island Mode l ).       This document describes the process and basic requirements for evaluating and supporting teachers  with the Rhode Island  Model . Through  this model , we hope to help create a culture where all teachers  have a clear understanding of what defines excellence in their work; receive prioritized, specific, and  actionable feedback about their performance; and receive support to continuously improve their  eff ectiveness, regardless of the number of years they have been teaching.    How to Use the  Guidebook   In this guidebook we clearly separate and label aspects of  the model that  local education agencies ( LEAs )   can  customize as  Flexibility Factors.   Throughout the  guidebook, we indica te corresponding resources available  on the RIDE website. These resources aim to help  educators understand  how  to  best  implement various  aspects of the Rhode Island Model . Resources include  on line tra ining modules , sample Student Learning/Outcome  Objectives, and  a suite of calibration protocols designed to  help school and  LEA   leaders facilitate ongoing calibration  exercises.    Selecting the Appropriate Model    We recognize that teacher roles may look different in various local contexts.  A ny public school  employee working under a teacher certification   whose primary responsibilities include instructional  planning, managing a classroom environment, and  student inst ruction should use the teacher version of  the Rhode Island Model.       Flexibility Factor      Boxes like this one   will be used  throughout the guidebook to highlight  where schools and  LEA s have an  opportunity to customize aspects of  the Rhode Island Model   and establish  policies to meet their local needs.    

3     Rhode Island Model at a Glance   Requirements for Teachers in the Full Evaluation Year   The table below outlines the minimum requirements for teach ers   in the full evaluation year.   Element   Minimum Requirements   Evaluation  Conferences      Three conferences   between the teacher and the evaluator (beginning - of - year, middle - of - year and end - of - year)    Professional Practice      At least three classroom observations (one announced at least a week  in advance and two unannounced) of at least 20 minutes each using  the Teacher Professional Practice  Rubric (Classroom Environment &  Instruction)      Written feedback after each observation        C  omponent - level scores and rationales after each observation   Professional  Responsibilities       Holistic ratings on each of the  nine   components of the Teacher  Professional Responsibilities Rubric   Professional Growth  Goal      O ne professional growth goal written  by the teacher   and approved by  the evaluator   at the beginning of the year and scored by the evaluator  at the end of the year   Student Learning    UPDATED 7/2019      At least two  SLOs   - or -      Embedded Practice or Student Learning Goals   Final Effectiveness  Rating         C  alculated using  a  points - based system, with each measure having  the following weights:      Professional Practice: Classroom Environment (25 percent)      Professional Practice: Instruction (25 percent)      Professional Responsibilities (20 percent)      Student Learning (30   percent)   Performance  Improvement Plans        Development and implementation of a Performance Improvement Plan  for any teacher receiving a FER of  Developing   or  Ineffective   as defined  in Standard Four of the Educa tor Evaluation System Standards   Requirements for Teachers  in the Non - Summative Year of the Cyclical Process   Teachers   not being evaluated because they are   in the  non - summative year of the  cyclical process at a  minimum   must   have an annual conference with their evaluator.     

4     Evaluation  Frequency    Evaluation frequency is determined by Rhode Island General Law 16 - 12 - 11.   The table below identifies  how frequently teachers must be evaluated.   Teachers who…   Evaluation Frequency   Received a  Final Effectiveness Rating   of  Highly Effective   on their most  recent evaluation   No more than once  every three years   Received a  Final Effectiveness Rating   of  Effective   on their most recent  evaluation   No more than once  every two years   Received a  Final Effectiveness Rating   of  Developing   or Ineffective   on  their most recent evaluation   Annually   Do not have tenure   Annually   Are using a different certificate in their current placement than they were  during their most recent evaluation   Annually   Received no rating in the prior year   Annually   When   C  an  E valuations  B e   C  onducted  M ore  F requently?      An LEA may provide more frequent evaluations than stipulated above as part of a negotiated  collective bargaining agreement.      If concerns arise about a tenured teacher’s performance, the teacher may receive more  frequent evaluations so long as actions are in accordance with the negotiated collective  bargaining agreement. Triggers for more frequent evaluations may include, but are not limited  to, informal classroom walkthroughs, professional conduct,   and  measures o f student learning.   Annual Conferences   The legislation calls for annual conferences for all  teachers rated  Highly Effective   and  Effective   who are  in a  non - summative year .  T he legislation states: “The conference shall be in accordance with a process  and sco pe determined by each school  LEA ’s educator evaluation committee.” The purposes of these  conferences may include but are not limited to   the following :      F eedback on classroom walkthroughs      D iscussions about other local student learning measures      O ther feedback   that will assist with professional growth and the improvement of  practice   and  student learning  

5     System Overview   Evaluation  Measures   The Rhode Island Model relies on multiple measures to paint a fair, accurate, and comprehensive  picture of teacher  performance .   All teachers will be evaluated on  four   measures :   1.   Professional Practice : Classroom Environment   –   This measure represents Domain 2 of the  Teacher Professional Practice Rubric, which includes four components.   2.   Professional Practice :   Instruction  –   This measure represents Domain 3 of the Teacher  Professional Practice Rubric, which includes four components.   3.   Professional Responsibilities   –   The Professional Responsibilities Rubric includes four  domains: School Responsibilities and Communication, Profess ionalism, Professional Growth,  and Planning. The ratings of these four domains combine to create one measure of Professional  Responsibilities.    4.   Student Learning   –   This measure assesses the   teacher’s impact on student learning through  the use of Student Lea rning Objectives (SLOs) and/or Student Outcome Objectives (SOOs),  Student Learning Goals, or Embedded Practice,  whe re  applicable.     Evidence   from each of the four   measures  combine to produce a  Final Effectiveness Rating   of  Highly  Effective ,   Effective ,   Developing , or  Ineffective.       Professional  Practice:  Classroom  Environment 25% Professional  Practice: Instruction 25% Professional  Responsibilities 20% Student  Learning  30% Final  Effectiveness  Rating

6     Performance Level Descrip tors   Each of the four  Final Effectiveness Rating s   has an associated  p erformance  l evel  d escriptor that  provides a general description of what the rating is  intended   to mean , with the acknowledgement t hat  exceptions do exist .  Performance  level descriptors   can help clarify expectations  and promote a  common understanding of the differences between the  f inal  e ffectiveness  r atings of  Highly Effective ,  Effective ,   Developing ,   and Ineffective.  Additional  information about how to interpret the ratings is  available by examin ing  the detailed  scoring rubrics and related evaluation materials.     Highly Effective  –   A  Highly Effective   rating indicates outstanding performance by the teacher.   A  teacher who earns a  Highly Effective   rating has a very high, positive impact on the learnin g of  students and exhibits high - quality professional behaviors regarding teaching and professional  responsibilities.   Effective  –   An   Effective   rating indicates consistently strong performance by the teacher.   A teacher  who earns an  Effective   rating has a  strong , positive impact on the learning   of students and exhibits  high - quality professional behaviors regarding teaching and professional respons ibilities.   Developing  –   A  Developing   rating indicates inconsistent performance or consistently moderate  performance by the teacher.   A teacher who earns a  Developing   rating has one aspect much weaker  than the other (either impact on the learning of  students or professional behaviors), or is consistently  moderate in both.   Ineffective  –   An  I ne ffective   rating indicates consistently low performance by the teacher.   A teacher  who earns an  Ineffective   rating has a low or negative impact on the learning of  students and exhibits  low quality professional behaviors regarding teaching and professional responsibilities .            

7     P rimary and Complementary Evaluators   The primary evaluator for most teachers  is   the  principal  or assistant principal, who  is   responsible for leading the  overall evaluation process, including assigning the  Final  Effectiveness Rating . Some schools/ LEA s may also  decide to use complementary evaluators to assist the  primary evaluator. Complementary evaluators are often  educators wit h specific content knowledge, such as  department heads or curriculum coordinators. All  new  evaluators are expected to complete training on the  Rhode Island Model.      Complementary evaluators may assist primary  evaluators by conducting observations, collecti ng  additional evi dence, and providing  feedback.   Like  primary evaluators, complementary evaluators are  required to give teachers written feedback   after  classroom observations.   A   complementary evaluator  should share his or her feedback with the primary  evalu ator as it is collected.   Primary evaluators will have sole responsibility for assigning final ratings.   Ensuring Fairness and Accuracy   To help ensure fairness and accuracy, the Rhode Island Model uses multiple measures to assess  performance.  According to the Educator  Evaluation   System Standards  LEAs will:        E nsure that all evaluators receive comprehensive training and  opportunities for calibration , thus  promoting demonstration of valid and accurate judgments .      P rovide ongoing training on the  evaluation system to all educators .       C  ollect and analyze evaluation data to identify individual and collective professional  development needs .        P rovide opportunities for educators to participate in professional development that meets these  individual and co llective professional development needs .      P rovide intensive support  to  educators new to the profession, educators new to a certificate  area, educators new to the  LEA , and educators who do not meet expectations for educator  quality .      I dentify the ways in whic h evaluation data are used to demonstrate each of the four levels of  effectiveness and the actions that result from each rating .      E nsure that the  LEA   evaluation committee regularly reviews the system and engages in  activities to maintain and improve the eva luation system, such as strategic planning, planning   professional development, assuring adequate resources, analyzing data and recommending  changes, and assessing fidelity of implementation .   Flexibility Factor     Evaluators        Schools/LEA s have the flexibility to  decide who will ser ve as the primary  evaluator.      LEA   policy or the local collective  bargaining agreement  may allow   for  the use of complementary  evaluators .        Schools and  LEA s may also choose  to select individuals based within or  outside the school or  LEA   in which  they serve as evaluators.   This could  consist   of a single peer evaluator or  a team of peer  evaluators.    

8     Support and Development   Every school is unique ,   and   support and development  should   not look exactly the same for everyone.  However, the Rhode Island Model is designed to support teacher development   by :      Outlining high expectations   that are clear and aligned with school,  LEA , and state priorities .        Establish ing a common vocabulary   for meeting expectations .      Encouraging student - focused conversations  to share best practices and address common  challenges .      Grounding teacher professional development   in data - driven collaboration, conferencing,  observation, and feedb ack to meet shared goals for student achievement .      Providing a reliable process  for educators to   focus  practice and drive student learning .   Evaluation Conferences   (Beginning/Middle/End)   The three evaluation conferences   represent  opportunities   for honest,  data - driven conversations focused on  promoting continuous improvement.      Beginning - of - Year Conference:  The teacher and  evaluator discuss the teacher’s past performa nce,  Professional Growth Goal ,  student learning , and the  upcoming year. When discussing the  student learning ,  teachers and evaluators can improve transparency of  expectations by making sure they share a  common  understanding of  the criteria for   Not Met, Nearly Met, Met,  and Exceeded.     Mid - Year Conferenc e:  The teacher and evaluator  discuss all aspects of th e teacher’s performance to date.  Discussions should  address  Professional Practice :  Classroom Environment, Professional Practice:  Instruction,  Professional Responsibilities,  and Student  Learning.  In some cases, the teacher and evaluator may revise  the  Professional Growth Goal and/or  student learning   based on discussion between the teacher and evaluator.   For example, a teacher with  high mobility may need to compare  the   current roster to the one upon   which the targets were set. If  there are substantial differences, adjustments to the target may be necessary to include all stude nts on  the most recent roster  and exclude students who are no longer on the class roster.     While  Final Effectiveness Rating s a re not determined until the end of the evaluation cycle, the Mid - Year  Conference is an important point in the year when specific concerns should be addressed , especially  if  they indicate that a teacher ’s impact on student learning is below expectations.   Teachers should  already be aware of specific concerns through  ongoing   feedback and prior documentation so that they  are not addressed for the first time at the conference.   If the teacher is struggling, and has not started  an  Improvement Plan, the Mid - Year   Conference is an opportune time to craft an initial plan together.   Flexibility Factor   Evaluation Conferences      The length of each conference is  decided at the local level, though we  recommend at least 15 minutes per  conference. Conference length  should match the purpose of the  conference to meet stated goals.     Beginning - of - Year Conferences may  be held in groups, su ch as by team  or content area, in order to  collaborate around  student learning  and PGGs.  A teacher may request  an individual conference to address  personal goals or concerns.    

9       End - of - Year Conference:   T he t eacher and evaluator review summative feedback on Professional  Practice : Classroom Environment, Professional Practice: Instruction   and Professional  Responsibi lities   (including Professional Growth Goal)   and discuss  student learning   results .   They   also discus s progress  toward the teacher’s  Performance Improvement Plan   if applicable . During or soon   after the conference, the  evaluator fina lizes and shares the teacher’s  Final  Effectiveness Rating   for the school year.   Performance Improvement Plans   The goal of the  P erformance  I mprovement  P lan is to  ensure that educators who are in need  of support   receive it.   A teacher who has a Performance  Imp rovement Plan  works   with an improvement team to  develop   the plan . An improvement team may consist  solely of the   teacher ’s evaluator or of multiple people,  depending on the teacher’s needs and the school and  LEA   context.   Required Components  of Performance  Improvement Plan Requirements   Any teacher who receives a  Final Effectiveness Rating   of  Developing  or  Ineffective  must have a  Performance Improvement Plan the following year.   Performance Improvement Plans must:      Include time - bound goals, action steps, and be nchmarks.       Identify action steps the teacher will take to improve his or her practice.      Clearly identify who is responsible for implementing each aspect of the plan.      Plan for f requent check - ins with the evaluator or other support personnel .   The  Educator  Eva luation System Standards require  LEA s to establish personnel policies that use  evaluation information   to inform decisions . A teacher who does not demonstrate sufficient improvement  may be subject to personnel actions, according to  local   policies.     Flexibility Factor   Performance Improvement Plans      An evaluator may put a teacher on a  Performance Improvement Plan at any  time during the year if concerns arise.   This  applies to all teachers regardless of  their status in the cyclical process.  

10     P rofessional Practice :   Classroom Environment & Instruction   The Rhode Island Model’s Teacher Professional Practice Rubric , which can be found in  Appendix 3 ,   was adapted from Domains 2 and 3 of the 2013 version of Charlotte Danielson’s  Framework for  Teaching .   The Teacher Professional Practice rubric consists of  eight  components organized into two  domains: Classroom Environment and Instruction.   More specifically:      The Teacher Professional Practice Rubric is  align s   with the Rhode Island Professional Teaching  Stan dards.      The Teacher Professional Practice Rubric is a classroom observation tool. Each  of the two  domains consists of four components   that  will be scored after each observation.        The Teacher Professional Practice Rubric includes both  Critical Attributes   and  Possible  Examples   for each component that are intended to help clarify the performance level.  No part of  the rubric is   intended to be used as a checklist.    Teacher Professional Practice Rubric Components   Professional Practice:    Classroom Environment   Domain 2   Professional Practice:    Instruction   Domain 3   2a :   Creating an Environment of Respect and       Rapport   3a :   Communicating with Students   2b :   Establishing a Culture for Learning   3b :   Using Questioning/Prompts and Discussion      Techniques   2c :   Managing  Classroom Procedures   3c :   Engaging Students in Learning   2d :   Managing Student Behavior   3d :   Using Assessment in Instruction    

11     Assessing Teacher Professional Practice   In the Rhode Island Model, data collected through classroom  observations informs component - level scores on the Teacher  Professional Practice   Rubric in  Classroom   Environment and  Instruction   as  well as feedback designed to help teachers  improve their practice.    Classroom Observation Requirements :      At least three classroom observations ( one announced   at  least a week in advance and  two unannounced ) of at  least 20 minutes each using the Teacher Profe ssional  Practice Rubric      Written feedback after each observation         Component - level scores and rationales after each  observation   Feedback   High - quality feedback helps teachers improve by identifying  strengths (practices they should continue) and areas for  imp rovement (changes to their practice that should be  prioritized). To be effective, feedback after a classroom  observation should be prioritized, specific, actionable,  delivered with a supportive tone ,   and provided to the teacher  as soon aft er the observatio n as possible.         Flexibility Factor   Classroom Observations and  Feedback      Schools and  LEA s may decide to  conduct  additional  classroom  observations   beyond the minimum  of three.   RIDE   encourage s   frequent visits to classrooms, with  additional observations  for  teachers on Performance  Improvement Plans.       A   one - week window for an  announced observation is  required,  but  evaluators may  choose to narrow down a  timeframe within that week (e.g., “I  plan to observe a math lesson”).  Because schools and  LEA s have  some flexibility with scheduling  announced observations, teachers  and evaluators should be clear  about what is expect ed at the local  level.      Written feedback is required after  each classroom observation, but  pre -   and post - observation  conferences are optional.   Schools  and  LEA s can choose to implement  pre -   and/or post - observation  conferences depending on what  works best fo r their local needs.      

12     Professional  Responsibilities   Teachers’ roles extend beyond delivering instruction and  establishing  the classroom environment. The  Rhode Island  Model recognizes the additional contributions teachers  make to school communities through the Teacher  P rofessional  Responsibilities   Rubric , found in  Appendix  4 .       The Teacher Professional  Responsibilities   Rubric includes  nine   components that a re aligned with the  Rhode Island  Professional Teaching Standards, the Rhode Island  Educational Leadership Standards, and the  Rhode Island  Code of Professional Responsibility.     Evaluators score t he  nine   components  using the   rubric based  on evidence collected during the year.  Evaluators can  observe   a ll of the components  in action   but may choose  to  collect additional evidence through artifact review  (e.g.,  checking weekly plans  for the planning components).     Evaluators should  maintain notes that serve as evidence of  components seen in action   and integrate feedback on this  evidence into evaluation conference discussions. If  evaluators choose to review artifacts, a rtifact review should  focus on quality rather than quantity.   One a rtifact could be  used to demonstrate proficiency on more than one  component of the rubric.   P rofessional Growth  Goal   All teachers in their  summative   evaluation year   must create  a   Professional Growth Goal   (PGG)   at the beginning of the  year. The evaluator  will score the goa l at the end of the year  using  PR 7 of the  Professional Responsibilities Rubri c .   This  goal must focus the teacher’s professional  development througho ut the year and should   also :         Be informed by school, district, or educator data .      Address  a school, district, or personal goal .      Align with the Teacher Professional Practice and/or Teacher Professional Responsibilities Rubrics .      Be specific, measurable, and actionable .      Include specific action steps .      Identify how goal attainment will be measure d.      Be discussed and finalized during or directly after the Beginning - of - Year Conference .     While it is ideal to establish a goal that is ambitious but realistic, the Mid - Year Conference provides a  formal opportunity for the teacher and evaluator to review the  PGG   and make adjustments if necessary.     Flexibility Factor    Professional Responsibilities      Schools and  LEA s have the flexibility  to determine the evidence that will  be used for the Professional  Responsibilities   components. RIDE  recommends assessing components  in action whenever possible.      Schools and  LEA s can choose to  provide “formative scores” at the  mid - year for Professional  Responsibilities   Rubric.  On the Mid - Year Conference form in EEM there  is an option to provide a formative  score for one or more of the  components.      A formative score provided at the  mid - year does not have to match  the score provided a t the end - of - year   conference .       LEAs may choose to have teachers  write Professional Growth Goals in  their non - summative years of the  cyclical process.  

13     Measures of Student Learning   Impro ving student learning is  central to the work of education. As such,  measuring student lea rning  continues to be   a critical pa rt of the teacher evaluation process .  Measures of student  learning are  included in teacher evaluations because:      Student learning measures, when combined with classroom observations and evidence of  Professional Responsibilities ,   improve the accuracy of the  Final Effectiveness Rating s for  teachers 1 .      Analyzing student learning data is  a  best practice for self - reflection and increased collaboration  around student learning.      Student learning is a critical indicator of teacher effectiveness.   Student Learning Options   Starting in the 2019 - 20 school year ,  the   Rhode Island Model  offers the flexibility to choose one of the four   following  student learning options through which   to assess  a   teacher’s impact   on student learning :      Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) / Student Outcome Objectives   (SOOs)      SLO /SOO   Flex      Student Learning Goals      Embedded Practice   The se student learning options come  in response to educators across the state  who, since the  inception of educator evaluation system s   in 2012 - 13,  called for additional  options for measuring   student  learning authentic ally and accurately across evaluation systems.  While SLOs have valuable  components through which to focus on students’ learning, stakeholders agreed that there was an  opportunity to collaborate and innovate to improve the student learning component of edu cator  evaluation systems, which  altogether , are considered a valuable and high - quality practice that supports  educator effectiveness.   Starting in 2016, RIDE partnered with national and statewide stakeholders who shared an investment in  the continuous impro vement of educator effectiveness systems.  This collaborative effort included a  two - year  pilot   of new models for student learning during the 2017 - 18 and 2018 - 19 school years through  which teams of educators across Rhode Island innovated on the process of m easuring student learning  within  local contexts.  It was through this concerted effort that, after two years of strategic engagement  with the field, RIDE published the new student learning options.   For the purposes of streamlining information about these o ptions, this teacher guidebook will elaborate  on the SLO/SOO and SLO /SOO   Flex options, as they continue to operate much in the same way as it  has since the inception of the RI Model Evaluation Model.     In short, there are no formal changes to the  existing S LO/SOO process in regards to the guidance .  The SLO /SOO   Flex option is an evolved                                                     1   Kane, T. J , McCaffrey, D. F. , Miller, T.,  &  Staiger, D .O . (2013).

14     version of the traditional SLO /SOO   where flexibilities learned from the   pilot can be applied  to certain  sections of the SLO /SOO   template s .   The newest options for student lear ning are the  Student Learning Goals   and Embedded Practice  models . While Student Learning Goals uses the same flexibilities and procedures as SLO Flex, its use  of a holistic scoring approach through new  3e scoring component,  Demonstrating Instructional  Outcomes   separates it from the traditional and flexible SLO options. And finally, Embedded Prac tice  also employs the 3e scoring component, and provides the least amount of structure when compared to  the other student learning options as it is framed by  informal and on - going data discussions between  the evaluator and the teacher, where conversations   about student learning are grounded in  shorter  cycles of instruction that are informed by  data.   Additional information and resources   regarding the  implementation of  Student Learning Goal s and  Embedded Practice models  should be formally reviewed on  our  Student Learning  webpage .    Student Learning Objectives   An SLO measures a teacher’s impact on student learning through demonstrated progress toward  academic g oals.  The SLO process is student - centered and curriculum - focused.   It recognizes the impact  teachers have in their classrooms, is based on research, and supports best - practices like prioritizing the  most important  learning  standards, implementing  curriculum, and planning assessments . Additionally :      The SLO  p rocess respects the diversity of all grades, subjects, and courses .   The best way  to measure student learning differs from one course or grade to another (e.g., measuring  student learning in a thi rd grade art class vs. a tenth grade chemistry class). SLOs present an  opportunity for teachers to be actively involved in deciding how to best measure the learning of  their specific population of students while providing a consistent process for all teach ers across  the state.        SLOs utilize the assessment process teachers think are best for their specific purposes.  SLOs   require teachers to identify the most important learning that occurs within their grade or  subject . Such   learning   should be measured by a high - quality , authentic   assessment . When  written  well, SLOs should include  assessments that require   students to  produce evidence   of  their learning .  However, the primary purpose of that assessment should be to measure what the  teacher is teaching and the students are learning.  No assessment should be used just to  collect evidence for an SLO.   NOTE:  Some special education teachers may use SOOs in place o f one or more of their SLOs. An  SOO is a long - term goal focused on an outcome that increases access to learning or creates conditions  that facilitate learning. Additional information about SOOs for special education teachers, including an  SLO/SOO  Decision  Tree, can be found on  page 2 5 .    

15     Preparation   Development   Instruction   Reflection    Collect, analyze,  and report final  evidence of  student learning.      Review outcomes  with the evaluator.      Reflect on  outcomes to  improve  implementation  and practice.    Review standards,  curriculum, and  units of study.      Review  assessments  currently used to  assign grades and  monitor students’  progress.      Determine priority  content.      Review available  historical student  data.    Get to know  students (collect  and analyze  baseline data).      Re - evaluate  priority content  based on s tudent  needs.      Draft and submit  SLOs.      Receive SLO  approval (revise if  necessary).      Teach and monitor  student learning.      Discuss progress  with colleagues  and evaluator(s).      Make adjustments  to SLOs by mid - year (if necessary).      Revise supports  and interve ntions  if students are not  progressing as  expected.      Collect, analyze,  and report on SLO  results.   The  Student Learning Objective   Process   Teachers   should, whe n ever possible, work collaboratively with grade, subject area, or course  colleagues to   develop   SLOs.   Teams of teachers can  craft SLOs together , but should  differenti ate   their  targets according to the students ’   baseline data .  The SLO process is meant to foster reflection and  conversation about the essential curriculum,  targeted outcomes , and assessment tools used in  classrooms across the state.     The  SLO   process mirrors a teacher’s planning, instruction, and assessment cycle as  described in  the  chart below :                             The Anatomy of  a Student Learning  Objective   T he SLO Form  is designed to elicit answers to three essential questions:       1.   What  are   the most important knowledge / skill s   I want my students to  attain  by the end of the  interval of instruction?     2.   Where are my students now (at the  beginning of instruction) with respect to the objective?     3.   Based on what I know about my students, where do I expect them to be by the end of the  interval of instruction and how will they demonstrate their knowledge /skill s ?      

16     Additional   Student Learning Fle xibilities    Beginning with the 2019 - 20 school year, LEAs will be able to implement new student learning  flexibilities: The SLO   Flex and the SOO Flex. For both SLOs and SOOs, teachers and support  professionals now have the option to employ flexible processe s and procedures in measuring  their  impact on student learning, either directly through demonstrated progress toward specific, measurable  goals, or through increasing access to learning.    The new flexibilities are the result of feedback from the field  –   bo th educators and evaluators have  wanted the option to tailor SLOs/SOOs in ways that align with specific school goals and/or local  context.  For example, teachers now have the option of focusing on a smaller subset of students  instead of including everyone  on their caseload.  Additionally, they could set several shorter cycle goals  that support an interval of instruction versus setting one year - long goal that may not prove practical  given the focus.  Finally, it is perfectly allowable to revise a target base d on data/evidence from a  shorter cycle of instruction. In this case, the new data - driven target would support the next cycle of  instruction.    As with any flexibility offered in the evaluation system, teachers must first seek leadership approval  before taking advantage of any of the following flexibilities:      Please know that whether or not the teacher  –   with approval from their evaluator  –   takes   advantage of  these new flexibilities, student learning continues to comprise 30% of the Final Effectiveness Rating.   You can read more about calculating a student learning score on  page 3 4   of this guidebook.        SLO Flex • Flexible processes and  procedures using the SLO  orignal template: • All students or a targeted  subset • One or more content standards • Year - long or shorter cycles of  instruction • Targets may be adjusted based  on data/evidence from shorter  cycles of instruction

18     Number and Scope of Student Learning Objectives     Educators and evaluators should work together to determine how many  SLOs   are appropriate for their  instructional area and teaching load.   The minimum number of  SLOs   an educator may set is two.  Educators should discuss their rationale for selecting a particular  course   or subject area with their  evaluators  at the beginning of the school year.       While  ideally  all  courses   or subjects the teacher instructs would  be includ ed in his or her set of  SLOs ,  sometimes the most effective strategy is to begin by focusing on a specific area of need and expanding  over time.       S tudents   An individual  SLO   must include all students on the roster for the course or subject area with which t he  obje ctive is aligned   if SLO Flex is not in effect .   An example for   a High School Math Teacher is below:     Algebra I   Calculus   Section A   Section B   Section C   Section A   Section B               Furthermore, percentages or particular groups of students may not be excluded.   For example,  students  with IEPs in a general education setting must be included in the general educator’s  SLO .   In  addition, teachers may not include absenteeism clauses into SLOs (e.g. “for  students   who are present  80% of the time) because these potentially exclude students. However, an evaluator can take extreme  absenteeism into account when scoring the SLO.     Sett ing   tiered targets accord ing to students’ starting points, whether  they are   measuring mastery or  progress,   is  recommended  because students may begin at varying levels of preparedness. However,  the expectation is that all students  should make   academic gains regardless of where they start. For  example, students who begin below grade - level may be expected to make substantial progress toward  course/grade objectives by the end of the instructional interval , reducing the gap between their current  a nd expected performance,   while students who begin on grade level may be expected to meet or  exceed proficiency by the end of the instructional period .   Baseline Data/Information   Data is information ,   and educators collect information from students every day in order to help them  plan effectively, adjust instruction, monitor progress, and assess student performance.   In order to set  appropriate long - term goals for students ,   educators must understand whe re their students are at the  beginning  of instruction.   When determining which baseline data are available and how they might be  used, consider the following:      Student data or information from prior years in many cases can be used to inform the teacher’s  un derstanding of students’ starting points.    Calculus  SLO includes   all students in both sections   Algebra I SLO includes  all students in all three sections  

19        If students have never been exposed to course content (e.g. students taking Spanish), it may be  more accurate to gather information on the students’ performance throughout the first few  weeks of the course .      Baseli ne data from a pre - test may be helpful when it is important to understand students’ skill or  knowledge level at the beginning of the course. These tests could include a teacher - created or  commercial assessment and focus on either the current or previous gr ade’s standards and content.    Baseline data/information can be used in two ways for  SLOs .   I t can inform the Objective Statement and  contribute to setting Targets.   In all scenarios baseline data/information is a must; however,  a pre - test/post - test model is not required and, in some cases,  might   be inappropriate.      The function of the baseline assessment is to provide information about where students are starting   in  order to set   appropriate targets.   This does not mean it is neces sary   to pinpoint  projected  student growth,  since  some targets may focus on reaching a  specific  level of proficiency.   Teachers should gather  information that helps them understand  how prepared  their students are to access  class  material.   Aligning Student  Learning Objectives   SLOs   should be horizontally and vertically aligned, when applicable. When  SLOs are   horizontally aligned ,  all teachers in the same grade level who teach the same course collaborate to set  SLOs  and then each  teacher sets specific targets  based upon his or her own students’ baseline knowledge and skills.     Vertical   align ment  means that   SLOs   build on one another   across a school , reflecting the scope of the  larger curriculum and comprehensive assessment system from grade to grade or course  level to course  level.   This requires significant collaboration and  requires  time   for a faculty to develop.     There may be instances in which teachers and building administrators collaborate to align their SLOs  as well.   In these cases, teachers can have dire ct or supportive alignment .   There are some instances  when it may not make sense for a teacher to align their SLOs with an administrator’s SLOs or with a  LEA   goal or improvement plan.       The re are   three ways to   think about alignment between teacher SLOs and building a dministrator SLOs:         Direct alignment   is when the focus of the objective statement, targets, and evidence sources  are shared.   The teacher’s SLOs mirror the building administrator’s SLOs.      Supportive  alignment   is when the content or skills addressed in the teacher’s SLO relates to  the content or skills of the building administrator’s   SLO ,  but is not identical   and may be  assessed using different evidence sources.        No alignment   is when the  teacher’s SLO   authentically reflect s   the most important content or  skills of his/her  discipline and grade level, but do not align with the content or skills of the  building administrator’s SLO.            

20     An example of each  type of alignment  can be seen   below .     Type   Example   Direct  Alignment   In a K - 5 school, multiple sources indicate that students struggle with literacy in the earlier  grades and numeracy in the upper grades. The principal set the focus for K - 2 on increasing  the number of students reading on grade level and for   3 - 5 increasing the number of  students who are proficient in math. The K - 2 teachers collaborated to write and share an  SLO focused on increasing the number of students reading on grade level and  differentiated their  Targets   according to the students in the ir individual classes. The 3 - 5  teachers did the same with their own shared focus on numeracy. The teachers SLOs were  directly aligned with the principal’s SLOs.     Supportive  Alignment   A middle school principal has set the focus on writing across the curri culum and students’  ability to respond to informational text in their transition to the Common Core literacy  standards. While some teachers ’ SLOs   might directly align to the building administrator’s  SLO, others might focus more on complimentary skills. For   example ,   an English teacher  might  write an   SLO on reading and responding to informational text, while a social studies  teacher might focus on synthesizing various primary and secondary sources focused  on the  social studies content.  The skills that the bui lding   administrator, English teacher, and social  studies teacher   focus on are  very   similar, but the SLOs are tailored to the content of the  course and the Evidence Sources are particular to each discipline.   No  Alignment   The school principal has written an SLO focused on math and one on literacy. While the  music teacher often incorporates math and literacy into her classroom and could align her  SLOs to support the two building administrator SLOs, the main focus of the curr iculum at  the middle school is music performance. Given this focus, the LEA music teacher’s  evaluator did not feel alignment would be appropriate.        NOTE:   It is essential that a teacher’s SLOs authentically reflect the most important content or skills of   the discipline and grade level they teach. We encourage  LEA administrators , school   administrators,   and  teams of teachers to work together toward common objective statements when appropriate, but we do  not recommend forcing alignment.   Rigor of Target     When setting the target(s) for  an SLO ,   the  teacher   s hould start by considering the most important  content/skills the students need to attain by the end of the interval of instruction (objective statement),  and where the students are with respect to the obj ective statement (baseline  data).      While the default target for any SLO should re flect mastery of the relevant  course or grade - level standards, the reality is that not all students begin with the  same level of preparedness. Therefore, targets may be tiere d to reflect  differentiated expectations for learning.     Setting tiered targets based on students’ prerequisite knowledge and skills helps  to ensure that the targets are rigorous and attainable for all students. Students  entering a course with high  proficiency or robust prerequisite skills will need to be challen ged by a higher   target. For students entering a course with lower proficiency or lacking prerequisite skills, a more modest  target may be appropriate in order to ensure that it is reasonably  attainable  in  the interval of instruction.    Where do  students  need to  be? Where  are  they  now? 

21     However, it is also important to consider the support a student or groups of students receive. For example,  students   may enter a course lacking prerequisite skills in reading, but they have a personal literacy pl an and  receive significant support from a reading specialist and a special education teacher. In this scenario, it may  make sense to raise expectations for what the student s   will be able to learn   or be able to do   by the end of  the interval of instruction b ecause of the intensity of support provided.    The  intent of tiered targets is not to calcify achievement gaps. The needs for fairness and appropriateness  should be balanced by the need to challenge lower - achieving students to catch up to their peers.  Addit ionally, while students in lower tiers may have a lower absolute target, reaching it may require them to  make  more progress   th an students with higher targets, resulting in a closing or narrowing of the  achievement gap(s).     The following grap hic shows one example of how to tier targets based on students’ preparedness for  the content:                                 Teachers   who collaborate on  SLOs   should also  confer about   targets ;   however t he targets for each  individual teacher must reflect the actual students in their class(es) .     Quality of Evidence   High - quality assessments are essential for accurate ly   measu ring   student learning.  In Rhode Island, a  teacher may use a  variety of summative assessments as evidence   for SLOs , including  performance tasks,  extended writing, research papers, projects,  portfolios, unit assessments,  final assessments, or a combination .  Teachers may use a ssess ments   purchased from a commercial  vendor or  created by individual teachers, teams of teachers,  LEA   leaders . However,   evaluators must  review  all assessments .     In most cases, teachers of the same course should share a n   SLO   that  includes   the same source(s) of  evidence.  Using a common source of evidence ensures   that students across the school or  LEA   in each  course  are required to demonstrate their understanding in the same way   and   presents an opportunity  for teachers to collaborate in the  creation   or selection   of the assessment , scoring,   as well as in  reviewing and analyzing assessment results. This collaboration promotes consistency and fairness ,   and  can make   the process more efficient for teachers and evaluators.      Selecting the right evi dence source is about finding the best assessment for the purpose.   In order to  make this determination, the question to ask is, “Is this evidence source  aligned   to what is being  measured?” Alignment   of evidence source   refers to:   Some students are  entering the course  without the necessary  prerequisite knowledge  or skills.   Some students are entering the  course with the necessary  prerequisite knowledge or skills.   Some students are  entering the course with  prerequisite  knowledge or  skills that exceed what is  expected or required.   Tier 1 Target   Tier 2 Target   Tier 3 Target  

22        Content   ( e.g . ,   SLO focuses on reading informational text and the evidence source focuses on  informational text)      Coverage   ( e . g.,   SLO includes five standards and all five of those standards are add ressed by  the evidence source)      Complexity   ( e.g.,  SLO addresses a variety of   DOK 2   levels and the evidence source includes  items/tasks aligned with those DOK levels).    An assessment may be high - quality for a particular purpose, but if it is not aligned to the  content  standards of the  SLO, it is not the best choice.  Additionally, the use of a single evidence source can be  problematic if it does not capture the full breadth of skills and knowledge identified in the Objective  Statement.  The following example describes an example where the teacher uses multiple sources o f  evidence in the SLO:   Other considerations for determining the quality of an evidence source include format, item type, and  administration and scoring procedures. In most cases, the evidence source(s) should be as authentic  as possible without being impra ctical to administer and score.   The table below includes further guidance on selecting high - quality evidence sources.   These  Assessment Quality Descriptors represent some of the most important aspects of an assessment to  consider. Some of the criteria are i nherent to the assessment (e.g., the purpose), while others relate to  an educator’s use of the assessment (e.g., the scoring process).   Assessment Quality Rubric   for SLOs:   High  Quality      Assessment is   aligned with its intended use .      Assessment   measures   what is   intended .      Items re present a variety of DOK levels.      Assessment includes a sufficient   number of items to reliably assess content .      Assessment includes some higher - level DOK constructed response items at least one very  challenging item .      Assessment is grade le vel appropriate and aligned to the curriculum .      Scoring is objective   (includes scoring guides and benchmark work), and uses a collaborative   scoring process .   Moderate  Quality      Assessment is loosely aligned to its intended use .      Assessment mostly measures   what   is intended .      Items represent more than one level of DOK .      Assessment includes a sufficient number of items to reliably assess most content .      Assessment is grade level appropriate .      Scoring may include scoring guides to decrease subjectivity, and/or may  include collaborative scoring .   Low   Quality      Assessment is not aligned to its intended use .        Assessment does not   measure what is intended .      Items represent only one level of DOK .      Assessment includes an insufficient number of items to reliably assess most  content .      Assessment is not grade level appropriate .      Scoring is open to subjectivity, and/or not collaboratively scored .                                                          2   DOK refers to Webb’s (2002) Depth of Knowledge Framework, which includes four levels of cognitive demand: Level 1:  Recall, Level 2: Skill/Concept, Level 3: Strategic Thinking, Level 4: Extended Thinking. See CAS Criteria & Guidance p. 15.  

23     Multilingual Learner (MLL) / English Learner (EL) Students     General educators should incorporate   Multilingual Learners (MLLs) and   English Learners (ELs) in their  SLOs. Teachers may set differentiated targets to ensure that all students are meeting a rigorous, yet  attainable, target. In some cases, evidence may need to be differentiated for  MLL/ EL   students   to account  for how they cur rently  use language to  demonstrate content skills and knowledge.  All teachers should  ensure their content targets for  MLL/ EL   students   are aligned to  both   grade level state adopted content  standards and the  WIDA English Language Development (ELD) standards .     As noted in  WIDA’s Guiding Principles of Language Development , l anguage is learned within context, as  one  learn s   content. Therefore,  teachers   need both language and content objectives for MLL/EL   students .  For more information regarding language and content objectives for MLLs/ELs, please visit  Essential  Actions: A Handbook for Implementing WIDA's Framework for English Language Development  Standards .     MLL/EL  p rogram models vary across schools in RI. In the vast majority of c ases, educators working with  ELs will need to align the SLO objectives to both content  and   WIDA standards. In the few cases where  teachers are solely delivering core English Language Development (ELD), they may focus on alignment  to WIDA standards. In both   cases, evidence should include ACCESS for ELs, the WIDA Model, LasLinks  English, or other Language Proficiency Assessments. Regardless of which assessment is   used , scoring  approaches should be calibrated with local and national methods.      We encourage all   educators and administrators to visit the  Multilingual Learners (MLLs)/ English Learners  (ELs) page on our RIDE website   for current information and resources.   Students with Disa bilities   Special educators provide specially designed instruction in a variety of settings and delivery models to  meet the diverse needs of their students. Because of the unique needs of the students, special  educators’ impact on their students’ learning  may be measured through the use of SLOs and/or  Student Outcome Objectives (SOOs).   Please use the decision tree on Page 25 to determine whe n it  makes sense to set  SLOs or a combination of an SLO/SOO.   SLOs for students with disabilities should be   based on Co mmon Core  State S tandards or other  appropriate content standards, historical performance data, and other academic information.  Educators  working to support students’ skills across grade levels in core content can refer to the  interactive CCSS  coherence map for math skills , the  K - 5 (pp. 11 - 17) and 6 - 12 (pp. 36 - 40) standards in ELA , the  Next  Generation Science Standards (NGSS) resources for science skills   and  RIDE’s graduation proficiencies  and performance indicators for  History and Social Studies .  Those educators who instruct students  who  participate in alternative assessments should refer to the  Tested Essential Elements page on the RIDE  website   for information that can be used to inform instructional planning and goal - setting.   Although there may be overlap in the content, assessments, or evidence used, Individualized Education  Program  (IEP) goals cannot be used as SLOs.  SLOs include a complete roster of students,  whereas IEP goals are independently crafted for each student . IEPs can inform a teacher’s or an  instructional team’s SLOs by providing data to inform Baseline Data/Information  and Targets. IEP  goals, assessments, and other evidence may inform the SLOs on specific content areas.  

24     SOOs for students with disabilities are long - term goals set by special educators that are focused on  outcomes that increase access to learning. The focus   of an SOO is to foster academic success for  students. SOOs could be set for the full academic year or the length of time services are provided. An  SOO must be specific and measurable, and should be aligned to standards or school or LEA priorities,  when ap plicable.  For example,  SEL  Standard s   and  Indicators   in the areas of functional skills such as  self - management, responsible decision making, and relationship skills which are necessary for  students’ access to the   general education curriculum may be used for SOOs because they focus on  outcomes that increase access to learning.     Special educators   may   tier their SLO or SOO targets based on   student   baseline data/information to  ensure the targets are rigorous, yet att ainable for all students included within the SOO. There is no  maximum   number   of tiers an educator can create for a set of students. Some educators with smaller  caseloads may write SLOs/SOOs in which each student has his or her own target based on individualized  starting points and rate of progress. This data may be found within the   IEP. Special educators and  general educators  must   collaborate when setting targets for students with disabilities.      

25     SLO/SOO Decision Tree   This decision tree is  a guide  to assist special educators and support professionals in determining  whether they shou ld set an SLO, SOO, or a combination of both.   The determination of an educator’s  student learning options is based upon that educator’s role.  LEAs  need to  determine what type of  student learning m easure is most appropriate for the specific positions in the ir LEA.

27     Approving Student Learning/Outcome Objectives   In order for an  SLO/SOO   to be approved, it must be rated as acceptable on three criteria:    1.   Priority of Content   2.   Rigor of Target(s)   3.   Quality of Evidence   R eviewing  Student Learning/Outcome Objectives   at the Mid - Year   C  onference   Whether using the original SLO/SOO, SLO /SOO   Flex, Student Learning Goals, or Embedded Practice  options, t he  Mid - Year Conference offers an opportunity for teachers to review and discus s their  students’ learning progress with their evaluators.   Teachers and evaluators should work together to  ensure students’ learning needs are effectively addressed through instructional practice and supports.   If  students are not progressing as expected, t he teacher and evaluator should collaborate to revise the  supports and interventions in place to help accelerate student progress.    At   the Mid - Year Conference , if   it  has  become clear that an  SLO/SOO   is no longer appropriate, it may  be revised.   Revisions  should be rare   with the original SLO/SOO , but adjustments may be made if:       The teaching schedule or assignment has changed significantly .        Class compositions have changed significantly .      New, higher - quality sources of evidence are available .      Based on new information gathered since they were set, objectives fail to address the  most important learning challenges in the classroom/school.    NOTE:  There may be extenuating circumstances that do not fit these four categories in which the  evaluator mus t use professional judgment.   Additionally, when a teacher is using a student learning  option other than the original SLO/SOO, they have the “built - in” option of adjusting targets and/or  strategies based on student data; in these cases,  the circumstance nee d not be extenuating when  exercising the option of revising student learning targets  and/or strategies. For example, when  changing targets based on data from instruction,  teachers   should consult with the evaluator as part of  ongoing data discussions. In most cases, these discussions include not only a rationale for the change  based on the data, but the instructional strategies that will be continued and/or adjusted based on the  nee ds of students.      

28     Scoring Individual Student Learning/Outcome Objectives   The process for scoring individual SLOs/SOOs begins with a review of the available evidence  submitted by the teacher, including a summary of the results. Evaluators will score each in dividual  SLO/SOO as  Exceeded   (4) , Met   (3) , Nearly Met   (2) ,  or  Not Met   (1) .        Additional Student Learning/Outcome Objective Scoring Guidance   To help further clarify the definitions of  Exceeded, Met, Nearly Met,  and  Not Met , RIDE has developed  the following scoring guidelines that LEAs can choose to adopt.                      NOTE:   The additional SLO/SOO scoring guidance above does not eclipse local LEA policy. LEAs have  the flexibility to adopt the additional SLO/SOO scoring guidance , create their own guidance,   or ch o ose  to continue to use the  Exceeded, Met, Nearly Met,  and  Not Met   descriptions exclusively.  For example,  LEAs may want to create specific guidance for scoring SLOs that represent a small number of students.   • This category applies when all or almost all students met the target(s) and many students exceeded the target(s) . For example, exceeding the target(s) by a few points, a few percentage points, or a few students would not qualify an SLO/SOO for this category . This category should only be selected when a substantial number of students surpassed the overall level of attainment established by the target(s) . Exceeded • This category applies when all or almost all students met the target(s) . Results within a few points, a few percentage points, or a few students on either side of the target(s) should be considered “Met . ” The expectation for this category should be high and it should only be selected when it is clear that the students met the overall level of attainment established by the target(s) . Met • This category applies when many students met the target(s), but the target(s) was missed by more than a few points, a few percentage points, or a few students . This category should be selected when it is clear that students fell short of the level of attainment established by the target(s) . Nearly Met • This category applies when the results do not fit the description of what it means to have “Nearly Met . ” If a substantial proportion of students did not meet the target(s), the SLO/SOO was not met . This category also applies when results are missing, incomplete, or unreliable . Not Met Not Met • <70% of students  met their target Nearly Met • 70 - 89% of  students met their  target Met • At least 90% of  students met their  target Exceeded • At least 90% of  students met their  target AND • 25% of students  exceeded their  target 

29     Student Learning/Outcome   Objective Scoring Process Map       The SLO/SOO Scoring Process Map below outlines the specif ic steps an evaluator should take to  determine if individual SLOs/SOOs are  Exceeded, Met, Nearly Met,  or  Not Met.                                               Yes   Yes   No   No   Did a  substantial  amount of students  greatly exceed   their  targets?   How many students  reached   their targets?

30     Calculating a  Final Effectiveness Rating   The  Final Effectiveness Rating   is determined by combining the points from each of the four  measures   of the model.  The total number of points possible is 400 with Professional Practice: Classroom  Environment weighing 25%, Professional Practice: Instruction weighing 25%, Professional  Re sponsibilities weighing 20% and Student Learning weighing 30%.         Components of a  Final Effectiveness Rating   in Points       The  overall point value  is then converted   to one of four  Final Effectiveness Rating s:      Highly Effective (H)        Effective (E)        Developing (D)      Ineffective (I)   Th e  following section   explains how to calculate the  Final Effectiveness Rating .     Professional  Practice:  Classroom  Environment 25% 100 points Professional  Practice: Instruction 25% 100 points Professional  Responsibilities 20% 80 points Student  Learning  30% 120 points Final  Effectiveness  Rating

31     Step  1   –   Calculate   a Professional Practice:   Classroom Environment Score .      The evaluator scores e ach of the four components in   C  lassroom  E nvironment on the  Teacher  Professional Practice R ubric  after each observation.      T he individual component scores across observations  are   averaged  and round ed   to the nearest  tenth to get a summative score for each component.   The score  is always between 1.0 (l owest) and  4.0  (highest).        T he average scores for each component  are   added together  and round ed   to the nearest whole  number to get a  component sum .   The chart below provides an example .                  The total number of weighted points is calculated by dividing the component sum by the number of  components (4) and then multiplying by the measure’s weight  times   100  (25 % x  100 = 25 ).  The  lookup table below shows the  convers ion between the component sum and weighted points.   In the  example above, the teacher would earn 75 weighted points for Professional Practice: Classroom  Environment.

32     Step 2  –   Calculate a P rofessional  Practice: Instruction Score .      The evaluator scores e ach of the four components in  Instruction on the Teacher Professional  Practice R ubric after each observation.      The individual component scores across observations  are   averaged and round ed   to the nearest  ten th to  determine   a summative score for each component.   The score  is always between 1.0  (lowest) and 4.0  (highest).        The average scores for each component  are   added together and rounded to the nearest whole  number to get  a component sum for Instruction .   The  chart below provides an example:                            A lookup table is used to determine the number of weighted  points.   The total number of weighted  points is calculated by dividing the component sum by the number of components (4) and then  multiplying by the measure’s weight   times 100   (25 % x 100 = 25 ).  In the example above, the teacher  would earn 69 weighted points   for Professional Practice: Instruction.

33     Step 3  –   Calculate a Professional   R esponsibilities   Score .      Evaluators  review   all available data related to the teacher’s performan ce over the course of the  year.  Evaluators review performance descriptors for each professional  responsibilities component  and select the level for each component which best describes the teacher’s performance for the  year.   Each performance level has an assigned numerical point value.      T he scores for each component  will be added together  to get a tota l  P rofessional  R esponsibilities  Rubric  scor e .   The component sum will always be between 9 and 36 points.      A lookup table is used to determine the number of weighted points.   The total number of weighted  points is calculated by dividing the component su m by  the number of components (9 ) and then  multiplying by the measure’ s weight  times  (20 % x 100 = 20 ).  For example, a teacher with a  component sum of 29 would earn 64 weighted points for Professional Responsibilities.           Professional Responsibilities   20% of 400  points   80 points total   Component  Sum   Points   Weighted Points   36   4.00   80   35   3.89   78   34   3.78   76   33   3.67   73   32   3.56   71   31   3.44   69   30   3.33   67   29   3.22   64   28   3.11   62   27   3.00   60   26   2.89   58   25   2.78   56   24   2.67   53   23   2.56   51   22   2.44   49   21   2.33   47   20   2.22   44   19   2.11   42   18   2.00   40   17   1.89   38   16   1.78   36   15   1.67   33   14   1.56   31   13   1.44   29   12   1.33   27   11   1.22   24   10   1.11   22   9   1.00   20  

34     Step 4  –   Calculate a Student Learning Score.   Evaluators score each individual SLO/SOO as  Exceeded   (4), Met (3) , Nearly Met   (2) , or  Did Not Meet   (1) . The SLO/SOO Scoring Process Map on  page  33   outlines the specific steps an evaluator shou ld  take to determine  SLO/SOO scores.  Once individual SLOs/SOOs are scored, the number of points  earned  (1 - 4) on each   SLO  is   added together  to calculate a component sum.   A lookup table is used to  determine the number of weighted points. (For all student learni ng lookup tables, see  Appendix 2 .)  The  component sum is then  divide d   by the number of SLOs/SOOs   and   multiplied by   the weight of 30 to get  a total number of points.                       Step 5  –   Calculate the   total number of points earned.   T he total number of points  from  Professional  Practice:  Classroom Environment ,  Professional Practice:  Instruction ,   Professional Responsibilities and Student  Learning  is   added together to determine a  sum of the total numbe r of points out of a  pos sible 40 0 points.   In the example on the  right, the teacher earned 298 total weighted  points.   Step 6  –   Determine  the  Final Effectiveness Rating .   T he  Final Effectiveness Rating   is  assigned  using   the   lookup table   below  to determine one of four  possible ratings.   Because the teacher in the  example earned 298 weighted points, the final  effectiveness rating would be  Effective .

39     DOMAIN 2: THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT   Component 2a: Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport   An essential skill of teaching is that of managing relationships with students and ensuring that relationships among students   are positive and supportive.  Teachers create an environment of respect and rapport in their classrooms by the ways they interact with students and by the  interactions they encourage  and cultivate among students. An important aspect of respect and rapport relates to how the teacher res ponds to students and how students are permitted  to treat one another. Patterns of interactions are critical to the overall tone of the class. In a respectful environment, al l students feel valued, safe, and  comfortable taking intellectual risks. They do n ot fear put - downs or ridicule from either the teacher or other students.     “Respect” shown to the teacher by students should be distinguished from students complying with standards of conduct and beha vior. Caring interactions  among teachers and students are   the hallmark of component 2a (Creating an environment of respect and rapport); while adherence to the established  classroom rules characterizes success in component 2d (Managing student behavior).   The elements of Component 2a are:      Teacher interactions with students, including both words and actions    A teacher’s interactions with students set the tone for the classroom. Through their interactions, teachers convey that they  are interested in and care  about their students.        Student interactions with other students, including both words and actions    As important as a teacher’s treatment of students is, how students are treated by their classmates is arguably even more impo rtant to students. At its  worst, poor treatment causes  students to feel rejected by their peers. At its best, positive interactions among students are mutually supportive and creat e  an emotionally healthy school environment. Teachers not only model and teach students how to engage in respectful interaction s wi th one another but  also acknowledge such interactions.    Indicators include:      Respectful talk, active listening, and turn -   taking      Acknowledgement of students’ backgrounds and lives outside the classroom      B ody language indicative of warmth and caring shown  by teacher and students      Physical proximity      Politeness and encouragement      Fairness        

40     Component 2a: Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE EXAMPLES   4   Classroom interactions between the teacher and  students and  among students are highly  respectful, reflecting genuine warmth, caring, and  sensitivity to students as individuals. Students  exhibit respect for the teacher and contribute to  high levels of civility among all members of the  class. The net result is an env ironment where all  students feel valued and are comfortable taking  intellectual risks.      The teacher demonstrates knowledge and caring  about individual students’ lives beyond the class and  school.      There is no disrespectful behavior among students.      When neces sary, students respectfully correct one  another.      Students participate without fear of put - downs or  ridicule from either the teacher or other students.      The teacher respects and encourages students’  efforts.      The teacher inquires about a student’s soccer game   last weekend  (or extracurricular activities or hobbies).      Students say “Shah” to classmates who are talking while the teacher  or another student is speaking.      Students clap enthusiastically for one another’s presentations for a  job well done.      The teacher sa ys, “That’s an interesting idea, Josh, but you’re  forgetting . . .”      A student questions a classmate, “Didn’t you mean ____?” and the  classmate reflects and responds, “Oh, maybe you are right!”   3   Teacher - student interactions are friendly and  demonstrate general caring and respect. Such  interactions are appropriate to the ages,  cultures, and developmental levels of the  students. Interactions among students are  generally polite and respectful, and st udents  exhibit respect for the teacher. The teacher  responds successfully to disrespectful behavior  among students. The net result of the  interactions is polite, respectful, and business - like,  though students may be somewhat cautious  about taking intellect ual risks.      Talk between teacher and students and among  students is uniformly respectful.      The teacher successfully responds to disrespectful  behavior among students.      Students participate willingly, but may be somewhat  hesitant to offer their ideas in front  of classmates.      The teacher makes general connections   with  individual students.      Students exhibit respect for the teacher.      The teacher greets students by name as they enter the class or  during the lesson.      The teacher gets on the same level with students,  kneeling, for  instance, beside a student working at a desk.      Students attend fully to what the teacher is saying.      Students wait for classmates to finish speaking before beginning to  talk.      Students applaud politely following a classmate’s presentation to the   class.      Students help each other and accept help from each other.      The teacher and students use courtesies such as “please,” “thank  you,” and “excuse me.”      The teacher says, “Don’t talk that way to your classmates,” and the  insults stop.   2   Patterns of  classroom interactions, both between  teacher and students and among students, are  generally appropriate but may reflect occasional  inconsistencies, favoritism, and disregard for  students’ ages, cultures, and developmental levels.  Students rarely demonstrat e disrespect for one  another. The teacher attempts to respond to  disrespectful behavior, with uneven results. The net  result of the interactions is neutral, conveying  neither warmth nor conflict .      The quality of interactions between teacher and  students, or   among students, is uneven, with  occasional disrespect or insensitivity.      The teacher attempts to respond to disrespectful  behavior among students, with uneven results.      The teacher attempts to make connections with  individual students, but student reactions   indicate  that these attempts are not entirely successful.      Students attend passively to the teacher, but tend to talk, pass  notes, etc., when other students are talking.       A few students do not engage with others in the classroom, even  when put together in small groups.       Students applaud halfheartedly following a classmate’s presentation  to the class.      The teacher says, “Don’t talk that way to your classmates,” but the  studen t shrugs her shoulders.      1   Patterns of classroom interactions, both  between teacher and students and among  students, are mostly negative, inappropriate, or  insensitive to students’ ages, cultural  backgrounds, and developmental levels. Student  interactions are characterized by sarcas m, put - downs, or conflict. The teacher does not deal  with disrespectful behavior.         The teacher is disrespectful toward students or  insensitive to students’ ages, cultural backgrounds,  and developmental levels.       Student body language indicates feelings of  hurt,  discomfort, or insecurity.      The teacher displays no familiarity with, or caring  about, individual students.      The teacher disregards disrespectful interactions  among students.      A student slumps in his chair following a comment by the teacher.       Students r oll their eyes at a classmate’s idea; the teacher does not  respond.      Many students talk when the teacher and other students are talking;  the teacher does not correct them.       Some students refuse to work with other students.       The teacher does not call student s by their names.  

41     DOMAIN 2: THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT   Component 2b: Establishing a Culture for Learning   A “culture for learning” refers to the atmosphere in the classroom that reflects the educational importance of the work under taken by both students and  teacher. It describes the norms that govern the interactions among individuals about the activities and  assignments, the value of hard work and perseverance,  and the general tone of the class. The classroom is characterized by high cognitive energy, by a sense that what is happening   there is important, and by a  shared belief that it is essential, and rewardi ng, to get it right. There are high expectations for all students; the classroom is a place where the teacher and  students value learning and hard work.      Teachers who are successful in creating a culture for learning know that students are, by their natur e, intellectually curious, and that one of the many  challenges of teaching is to direct the students’ natural energy toward the content of the curriculum. They also know that st udents derive great satisfaction,  and a sense of genuine power, from mastering  challenging content in the same way they experience pride in mastering, for example, a difficult physical skill.     Part of a culture of hard work involves precision in thought and language; teachers whose classrooms display such a culture i nsist that studen ts use language  to express their thoughts clearly. An emphasis on precision reflects the importance placed, by both teacher and students, on  the quality of thinking; this  emphasis conveys that the classroom is a business - like place where important work is  being undertaken. The classroom atmosphere may be vibrant, even  joyful, but it is not frivolous.   THE ELEMENTS OF COMPONENT 2B ARE:      Importance of the content and of learning   In a classroom with a strong culture for learning, teachers convey the  educational value of what the students are learning.        Expectations for learning and achievement    In classrooms with robust cultures for learning, all students receive the message that although the work is challenging, they   are capable of achieving if they  are prepared to work hard. A manifestation of teachers’ expectations for high student achievement is their insistence on the  use of precise language by  students.        Student pride in work   When students are convinced of their capabilities, they are willing to  devote energy to the task at hand, and they take pride in their accomplishments.  This pride is reflected in their interactions with classmates and with the teacher.   INDICATORS INCLUDE:      Belief in the value of what is being learned      High e xpectations, supported through both verbal and nonverbal behaviors, for both learning and participation        Expectation of h igh - quality work on the part of students      Expectation and recognition of effort and persistence on the part of students       High e xpectations for expression and work products         

42     Component 2b: Establishing a Culture for Learning   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE EXAMPLES   4   The classroom culture is a cognitively busy place,  characterized by a shared belief in the importance of  learning. The teacher conveys high expectations for  learning for all students and insists on hard work;  students assume responsibility for high quality by  initiating improvements, making revisions, adding detail,  and/or assisting peers in their precise use   of language.      The teacher communicates passion for the subject.      The teacher conveys the satisfaction that accompanies a deep  understanding of complex content.      Students indicate through their questions and comments a  desire to understand the content.      Studen ts assist their classmates in understanding the content.      Students take initiative in improving the quality of their work.      Students correct one another in their use of language.      The teacher says, “It’s really fun to find the patterns  for factoring  polynomials.”      A student says, “I don’t really understand why it’s  better to solve this problem that way.”      A s tudent asks a classmate to explain a concept or  procedure since he didn’t quite follow the teacher’s  explanation.      Students question one another on  answers.      A s tudent asks the teacher for permission to redo a  piece of work since she now sees how it could be  strengthened.   3   The classroom culture is a place where learning is  valued by all; high expectations for both learning and  hard work are the norm  for most students. Students  understand their role as learners and consistently  expend effort to learn. Classroom interactions support  learning, hard work, and the precise use of language.      The teacher communicates the importance of the content and  the convi ction that with hard work all students can master   the  material.      The teacher demonstrates a high regard for students’ abilities.      The teacher conveys an expectation of high levels of student  effort.       Students expend good effort to complete work of high quali ty.      The teacher insists on precise use of language by students.      The teacher says, “This is important; you’ll need to  speak grammatical English when you apply for a job.”      The teacher says, “This idea is really important! It’s  central to our understanding of   history.”      The teacher says, “Let’s work on this together; it’s  hard, but you all will be able to do it well.”      The teacher hands a paper back to a student, saying, “I  know you can do a better job on this.” The student  accepts it without complaint.      Students   get to work right away when an assignment  is given or after entering the room.   2   The classroom culture is characterized by little  commitment to learning by the teacher or students.  The teacher appears to be only “going through the  motions,” and students  indicate that they are  interested in the completion of a task rather than the  quality of the work. The teacher conveys that student  success is the result of natural ability rather than hard  work, and refers only in passing to the precise use of  language. H igh expectations for learning are reserved  for those students thought to have a natural aptitude  for the subject.      The teacher’s energy for the work is neutral, neither indicating  a high level of commitment nor ascribing the need to do the  work to external  forces .      The teacher conveys high expectations for only some students.       Students exhibit a limited commitment to complete the work  on their own; many students indicate that they are looking for  an “easy path.”      The teacher’s primary concern appears to be to   complete the  task at hand.      The teacher urges, but does not insist, that students use  precise language.      The teacher says, “Let’s get through this.”      The teacher says, “I think most of you will be able to  do this.”      Students consult with one another to determine how  to fill in a worksheet, without challenging  one   another’s thinking.      The teacher does not encourage students who are  struggling.      Only s ome students get right to work after an  assignment is given or after en tering the room   1   The classroom culture is characterized by a lack of  teacher or student commitment to learning, and/or  little or no investment of student energy in the task at  hand. Hard work and the precise use of language are  not expected or valued.  Medium to low expectations  for student achievement are the norm, with high  expectations for learning reserved for only one or two  students.      The teacher conveys that there is little or no purpose for the  work, or that the reasons for doing it are due to ext ernal  factors.      The teacher conveys to at least some students that the work is  too challenging for them.      Students exhibit little or no pride in their work.      Students use language incorrectly; the teacher does not  correct them.        The teacher tells students tha t they’re doing a lesson  because it’s in the book or is district -   mandated.      The teacher says to a student, “Why don’t you try  this easier problem?”      Students turn in sloppy or incomplete work.      Many students don’t engage in an assigned task, and  yet the teac her ignores their behavior.      Students have not completed their homework; the  teacher does not respond.    

43     DOMAIN 2: THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT   Component 2c: Managing Classroom Procedures   A smoothly functioning classroom is a prerequisite to good instruction and high levels of student engagement. Teachers establ ish and monitor routines and  procedures for the smooth operation of the classroom and the efficient use of time. Hallmarks of a wel l - managed classroom are that instructional groups are  used effectively, non - instructional tasks are completed efficiently, and transitions between activities and management of materials and supplies ar e skillfully done  in order to maintain momentum and max imize instructional time. The establishment of efficient routines, and teaching students to employ them, may be  inferred from the sense that the class “runs itself.”    THE ELEMENTS OF COMPONENT 2C ARE:      Management of instructional groups   Teachers help  students to develop the skills to work purposefully and cooperatively in groups or independently, with little supervision fro m the teacher.      Management of transitions   Many lessons engage students in different types of activities: large group, small group,  independent work. It’s important that little time is lost as students  move from one activity to another; students know the “drill” and execute it seamlessly.      Management of materials and supplies    Experienced teachers have all necessary materials at hand an d have taught students to implement routines for distribution and collection of materials with a  minimum of disruption to the flow of instruction.      Performance of classroom routines   Overall, little instructional time is lost in activities such as taking att endance, recording the lunch count, or the return of permission slips for a class trip.   INDICATORS INCLUDE:      Smooth functioning of all routines      Little or no loss of instructional time      Students playing an important role in carrying out the routines      Students knowing what to do, where to move        

44     Component 2c: Managing Classroom Procedures   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE EXAMPLES   4   Instructional time is maximized due to efficient  and seamless classroom routines and  procedures. Students take  initiative in the  management of instructional groups and  transitions, and/or the handling of materials and  supplies. Routines are well understood and may  be initiated by students.        With minimal prompting by the teacher, the  students ensure that their time  is used  productively.      Students take initiative in distributing and collecting  materials efficiently.       Students themselves ensure that transitions and  other routines are accomplished smoothly.        Students redirect classmates in small groups not working direct ly with  the teacher to be more efficient in their work.      A student reminds classmates of the roles that they are to play within  the group.      A student redirects a classmate to the table he should be at following  a transition.      Students propose an improved atte ntion signal.      Students independently check themselves into class on the attendance  board.   3   There is little loss of instructional time due to  effective classroom routines and procedures. The  teacher’s management of instructional groups  and transitions,  handling of materials and  supplies, or both, is consistently successful. With  minimal guidance and prompting, students follow  established classroom routines.        The students are productively engaged during  small - group or independent work.      Transitions between   large -   and small - group  activities are smooth.      Routines for distribution and collection of  materials and supplies work efficiently.      Classroom routines function smoothly.        In small - group work, students have established roles; they listen to  one another,  summarizing different views, etc.      Students move directly between large -   and small - group activities.      Students get started on an activity while the teacher takes attendance.      The teacher has an established timing device, such as counting down,  to signal stude nts to return to their desks.      The teacher has an established attention signal, such as raising a hand  or dimming the lights.      One member of each small group collects materials for the table.      There is an established color - coded system indicating where materi als  should be stored.      Cleanup at the end of a lesson is fast and efficient.   2   Some instructional time is lost due to partially  effective classroom routines and procedures. The  teacher’s management of instructional groups  and transitions, or handling of  materials and  supplies, or both, are inconsistent, leading to  some disruption of learning. With regular  guidance and prompting, students follow  established routines.        Students not working directly with the teacher are  only partially engaged.       Procedures fo r transitions seem to have been  established, but their operation is not smooth.      There appear to be established routines for  distribution and collection of materials, but  students are confused about how to carry them  out.      Classroom routines function unevenl y.      Some students not working with the teacher are off task.      Transition between large -   and small - group activities requires five  minutes but is accomplished.      Students ask what they are to do when materials are being distributed  or collected.      Students ask cla rifying questions about procedures.      Taking attendance is not fully routinized; students are idle while the  teacher fills out the attendance form.     1   Much instructional time is lost due to inefficient  classroom routines and procedures. There is  little or  no evidence of the teacher’s managing  instructional groups and transitions and/or  handling of materials and supplies effectively.  There is little evidence that students know or  follow established routines.        Students not working with the teacher are not  productively engaged.       Transitions are disorganized, with much loss of  instructional time.      There do not appear to be any established  procedures for distributing and collecting  materials.      A considerable amount o f time is spent off task  because of unclear procedures.        When moving into small groups, students ask questions about where  they are supposed to go, whether they should take their chairs, etc.      There are long lines for materials and supplies.       Distributing o r collecting supplies is time consuming.      Students bump into one another when lining up or sharpening pencils.      At the beginning of the lesson,   r oll - taking consumes much time, and  students are not working on anything.      

45     DOMAIN 2: THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT   Component 2d: Managing Student Behavior   In order for students to be able to engage deeply with content, the classroom environment must be orderly; the atmosphere mus t feel business - like and  productive, without being authoritarian. In a productive  classroom, standards of conduct are clear to students; they know what they are permitted to do and  what they can expect of their classmates. Even when their behavior is being corrected, students feel respected; their dignity   is not undermined. Skilled  teac hers regard positive student behavior not as an end in itself, but as a prerequisite to high levels of engagement in content.   THE ELEMENTS OF COMPONENT 2D ARE:      Expectations   It is clear, either from what the teacher says, or by inference from student  actions, that expectations for student conduct have been established and that they  are being implemented.      Monitoring of student behavior   Experienced teachers seem to have eyes in the backs of their heads; they are attuned to what’s happening in the classro om and can move subtly to help  students, when necessary, re - engage with the content being addressed in the lesson. At a high level, such monitoring is preventive and subtle, which may  make it challenging to observe.      Response to student misbehavior   Even exp erienced teachers find that their students occasionally violate one or another of the agreed - upon standards of conduct; how the teacher  responds to such infractions is an important mark of the teacher’s skill. Accomplished teachers try to understand why st udents are conducting themselves  in such a manner (are they unsure of the content? are they trying to impress their friends?) and respond in a way that respec ts the dignity of the student.  The best responses are those that address misbehavior early in an e pisode, although doing so is not always possible.   INDICATORS INCLUDE:      Clear standards of conduct, possibly posted, and possibly referred to during a lesson      Absence of acrimony between teacher and students concerning behavior      Teacher awareness of student  conduct      Preventive action when needed by the teacher      Absence of misbehavior      Reinforcement of positive behavior        

46     Component 2d: Managing Student Behavior   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE EXAMPLES   4   Student behavior is entirely appropriate.  Students  take an active role in monitoring their  own behavior and/or that of other students  against standards of conduct. Teacher monitoring  of student behavior is subtle and preventive. The  teacher’s response to student misbehavior is  sensitive to individual stude nt needs and respects  students’ dignity.      Student behavior is entirely appropriate; any  student misbehavior is very minor and swiftly  handled.      The teacher silently and subtly monitors student  behavior.       Students respectfully intervene with classmates at  app ropriate moments to ensure compliance with  standards of conduct.      A student suggests a revision to one of the classroom rules.      The teacher notices that some students are talking among themselves  and without a word moves nearer to them; the talking stops.      The teacher speaks privately to a student about misbehavior.      A student reminds her classmates of the class rule about chewing gum.   3   Student behavior is generally appropriate. The  teacher monitors student behavior against  established standards of conduct.   Teacher  response to student misbehavior is consistent,  proportionate, and respectful to students and is  effective.      Standards of conduct appear to have been  established and implemented successfully.      Overall, student behavior is generally appropriate.      The  teacher frequently monitors student behavior.      The teacher’s response to student misbehavior is  effective.      Upon a nonverbal signal from the teacher, students correct their  behavior.      The teacher moves to every section of the classroom, keeping a close  eye on   student behavior.       The teacher gives a student a “hard look,” and the student stops  talking to his neighbor.   2   Standards of conduct appear to have been  established, but their implementation is  inconsistent. The teacher tries, with uneven  results, to moni tor student behavior and respond  to student misbehavior.      The teacher attempts to maintain order in the  classroom, referring to classroom rules, but with  uneven success.       The teacher attempts to keep track of student  behavior, but with no apparent system.      The teacher’s response to student misbehavior is  inconsistent: sometimes harsh, other times lenient.      Classroom rules are posted, but neither the teacher nor the students  refer to them.      The teacher repeatedly asks students to take their seats; some ignore  h er.      To one student: “Where’s your late pass? Go to the office.” To  another: “You don’t have a late pass? Come in and take your seat;  you’ve missed enough already.”     1   There appear to be no established standards of  conduct, or students challenge them. There is  little or no teacher monitoring of student  behavior and response to students’ misbehavior  is repressive or disrespectful of student dignity.       The classroom environ ment is chaotic, with no  standards of conduct evident.      The teacher does not monitor student behavior.      Some students disrupt the classroom, without  apparent teacher awareness or with an ineffective  response.      Students are talking among themselves, with no at tempt by the  teacher to silence them.      An object flies through the air, apparently without the teacher’s notice.      Students are running around the room, resulting in chaos.      Students use their phones and other electronic devices; the teacher  doesn’t attempt to   stop them.          

47     DOMAIN 3: INSTRUCTION   Component 3a: Communicating with Students   Teachers communicate with students for several independent, but related, purposes. First, they convey that teaching and learn ing are purposeful activities;  they make that  purpose clear to students. They also provide clear directions for classroom activities so that students know what to do; when   additional help  is appropriate, teachers model these activities. When teachers present concepts and information, they make those p resentations with accuracy, clarity, and  imagination, using precise, academic language; where amplification is important to the lesson, skilled teachers embellish the ir explanations with analogies or  metaphors, linking them to students’ interests and prior   knowledge. Teachers occasionally withhold information from students (for example, in an inquiry  science lesson) to encourage them to think on their own, but what information they do convey is accurate and reflects deep un derstanding of the content.  And te achers’ use of language is vivid, rich, and error free, affording the opportunity for students to hear language used well and   to extend their own  vocabularies. Teachers present complex concepts in ways that provide scaffolding and access to students.   THE  ELEMENTS OF COMPONENT 3A ARE:      Expectations for learning   The goals for learning are communicated clearly to students. Even if the goals are not conveyed at the outset of a lesson (fo r example, in an inquiry  science lesson), by the end of the lesson  students are clear about what they have been learning.      Directions for activities   Students understand what they are expected to do during a lesson, particularly if students are working independently or with  classmates, without direct  teacher supervision. Th ese directions for the lesson’s activities may be provided orally, in writing, or in some combination of the two, with modeli ng by  the teacher, if it is appropriate.       Explanations of content   Skilled teachers, when explaining concepts and strategies to  students, use vivid language and imaginative analogies and metaphors, connecting explanations  to students’ interests and lives beyond school. The explanations are clear, with appropriate scaffolding, and, where appropri ate, anticipate possible student  misc onceptions. These teachers invite students to be engaged intellectually and to formulate hypotheses regarding the concepts or   strategies being  presented.      Use of oral and written language   For many students, their teachers’ use of language represents their b est model of both accurate syntax and a rich vocabulary; these models enable  students to emulate such language, making their own more precise and expressive. Skilled teachers seize on opportunities both   to use precise, academic  vocabulary and to explain th eir use of it.   INDICATORS INCLUDE:      Clarity of lesson purpose       Clear directions and procedures specific to the lesson activities      Absence of content errors and clear explanations of concepts and strategies      Correct and imaginative use of language      

48     Component 3a: Communicating with Students   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE EXAMPLES   4   The teacher links the instructional purpose of the lesson  to the larger curriculum; the directions and procedures  are clear and anticipate possible student  misunderstanding. The teacher’s explanation of content  is thorough and clear, developing conceptual  understanding through clear scaffolding and connecting  with students’ interests. Students contribute to  extending the content by explaining concepts to thei r  classmates and suggesting strategies that might be used.  The teacher’s spoken and written language is expressive,  and the teacher finds opportunities to extend students’  vocabularies, both within the discipline and for more  general use. Students contribu te to the correct use of  academic vocabulary.      If asked, students are able to explain what they are learning and where it fits  into the larger curriculum context.      The teacher explains content clearly and imaginatively, using metaphors and  analogies to bring   content to life.      The teacher points out possible areas for misunderstanding.      The teacher invites students to explain the content to their classmates.      Students suggest other strategies they might use in approaching a challenge  or analysis.      The teacher uses   rich language, offering brief vocabulary lessons where  appropriate, both for general vocabulary and for the discipline.      Students use academic language correctly.      The teacher says, “Here’s a spot where some students have difficulty; be sure to  read it care fully.”      The teacher asks a student to explain the task to other students.      When clarification about the learning task is needed, a student offers it to  classmates.      The teacher, in explaining the westward movement in U.S. history, invites students to  conside r that historical period from the point of view of the Native Peoples.      The teacher asks, “Who would like to explain this idea to us?”      A student asks, “Is this another way we could think about analogies?”      A student explains an academic term to classmates.      T he teacher pauses during an explanation of the civil rights movement to remind  students that the prefix in -   as in inequality means “not,” and that the prefix un -   also means the same thing.      A student says to a classmate, “I think that side of the triangle i s called the  hypotenuse.”   3   The instructional purpose of the lesson is clearly  communicated to students, including where it is situated  within broader learning; directions and procedures are  explained clearly and may be modeled. The teacher’s  explanation  of content is scaffolded, clear, and accurate and  connects with students’ knowledge and experience. During  the explanation of content, the teacher focuses, as  appropriate, on strategies students can use when working  independently and invites student intell ectual engagement.  The teacher’s spoken and written language is clear and  correct and is suitable to students’ ages and interests. The  teacher’s use of academic vocabulary is precise and serves  to extend student understanding.      The teacher states clearly, a t some point during the lesson, what the  students will be learning.      The teacher’s explanation of content is clear and invites student  participation and thinking.      The teacher makes no content errors.      The teacher describes specific strategies students might  use, inviting  students to interpret them in the context of what they’re learning.       Students engage with the learning task, indicating that they understand what  they are to do.      If appropriate, the teacher models the process to be followed in the task.      T he t eacher’s v ocabulary and usage are correct and entirely suited to the lesson,  including, where appropriate, explanations of academic vocabulary.      T he t eacher’s v ocabulary is appropriate to students’ ages and levels of  development.      The teacher says, “By the e nd of today’s lesson you’re all going to be able to  factor different types of polynomials.”      In the course of a presentation of content, the teacher asks students, “Can  anyone think of an example of that?”      The teacher uses  a board or projection device for t ask directions so that  students can refer to it without requiring the teacher’s attention.      The teacher says, “When you’re trying to solve a math problem like this, you  might think of a similar, but simpler, problem you’ve done in the past and see  whether t he same approach would work.”      The teacher explains passive solar energy by inviting students to think about the  temperature in a closed car on a cold, but sunny, day or about the water in a  hose that has been sitting in the sun.      The teacher uses a Venn dia gram to illustrate the distinctions between a republic  and a democracy.   2   The teacher’s attempt to explain the instructional  purpose has only limited success, and/or directions and  procedures must be clarified after initial student  confusion. The  teacher’s explanation of the content may  contain minor errors; some portions are clear, others  difficult to follow. The teacher’s explanation does not  invite students to engage intellectually or to understand  strategies they might use when working independ ently.  The teacher’s spoken language is correct but uses  vocabulary that is either limited or not fully appropriate  to the students’ ages or backgrounds. The teacher rarely  takes opportunities to explain academic vocabulary.      The teacher provides little ela boration or explanation about what the  students will be learning.      The teacher’s explanation of the content consists of a monologue, with  minimal participation or intellectual engagement by students.      The teacher makes no serious content errors but may make  minor ones.      T he t eacher’s e xplanations of content are purely procedural, with no  indication of how students can think strategically.      The teacher must clarify the learning task so students can complete it.      The teacher’s vocabulary and usage are correct but  unimaginative.      When the teacher attempts to explain academic vocabulary, it is only  partially successful.      T he t eacher’s v ocabulary is too advanced, or too juvenile, for students.      The teacher mispronounces “____.”      The teacher says, “And oh, by the way, toda y we’re going to factor  polynomials.”      A student asks, “What are we supposed to be doing?” and the teacher clarifies  the task.      A s tudent asks, “What do I write here?” in order to complete a task.      The teacher says, “Watch me while I show you how to___,” aski ng students  only to listen.      A number of students do not seem to be following the explanation.      Students are inattentive during the teacher’s explanation of content.      Students’ use of academic vocabulary is imprecise.   1   The instructional purpose of the  lesson is unclear to  students, and the directions and procedures are  confusing. The teacher’s explanation of the content  contains major errors and does not include any  explanation of strategies students might use. The  teacher’s spoken or written language c ontains errors of  grammar or syntax. The teacher’s academic vocabulary  is inappropriate, vague, or used incorrectly, leaving  students confused.      At no time during the lesson does the teacher convey to the students what  they will be learning.      Students indica te through body language or questions that they don’t  understand the content being presented.      The teacher makes a serious content error that will affect students’  understanding of the lesson.      Students indicate through their questions that they are confused   about the  learning task.      The teacher’s communications include errors of vocabulary or usage or  imprecise use of academic language.      T he t eacher’s v ocabulary is inappropriate to the age or culture of the students.      A student asks, “What are we supposed to be   doing?” but the teacher ignores  the question.      The teacher states that to add fractions they must have the same numerator.      Students have a quizzical look on their faces; some may withdraw from the  lesson.      Students become disruptive or talk among themselves   in an effort to follow the  lesson.      The teacher uses technical terms without explaining their meanings.      The teacher says “ain’t.”  

49     DOMAIN 3: INSTRUCTION   Component 3b: Using Questioning/Prompts and Discussion Techniques   Questioning and discussion are the only instructional strategies specifically referred to in the Framework for Teaching, a de cision that reflects their central importance to teachers’  practice. In the Framework, it is important that questioning and discuss ion be used as techniques to deepen student understanding rather than serve as recitation, or a verbal “quiz.”  Good teachers use divergent as well as convergent questions, framed in such a way that they invite students to formulate hypo theses, make connect ions, or challenge previously  held views. Students’ responses to questions are valued; effective teachers are especially adept at responding to and buildin g on student responses and making use of their ideas.  High - quality questions encourage students to ma ke connections among concepts or events previously believed to be unrelated and to arrive at new understandings of complex  material. Effective teachers also pose questions for which they do not know the answers. Even when a question has a limited n umber of   correct responses, the question, being  nonformulaic, is likely to promote student thinking.      Class discussions are animated, engaging all students in important issues and promoting the use of precise language to deepen   and extend their understanding. The se discussions may  be based around questions formulated by the students themselves. Furthermore, when a teacher is building on student responses   to questions (whether posed by the teacher or by  other students), students are challenged to explain their thin king and to cite specific text or other evidence (for example, from a scientific experiment) to back up a position. This  focus on argumentation forms the foundation of logical reasoning, a critical skill in all disciplines.      Not all questions must be at a   high cognitive level in order for a teacher’s performance to be rated at a high level; that is, when exploring a topic, a tea cher might begin with a series of questions of  low cognitive challenge to provide a review, or to ensure that everyone in the clas s is “on board.” Furthermore, if questions are at a high level, but only a few students participate in the discussion,  the teacher’s performance on the component cannot be judged to be at a high level. In addition, during lessons involving stud ents in smal l - group work, the quality of the students’ questions and  discussion in their small groups may be considered as part of this component. In order for students to formulate high - level questions, they must have learned how to do so. Therefore, high - level  quest ions from students, either in the full class or in small - group discussions, provide evidence that these skills have been taught.   THE ELEMENTS OF COMPONENT 3B ARE:      Quality of questions/prompts   Questions of high quality cause students to think and reflect, to deepen their understanding, and to test their ideas against   those of their classmates. When teachers ask questions of high  quality, they ask only a few of them and provide students with suff icient time to think about their responses, to reflect on the comments of their classmates, and to deepen their  understanding. Occasionally, for the purposes of review, teachers ask  students a series of (usually low - level) questions in a type of verbal qui z. This technique may be helpful for the purpose  of establishing the facts of a historical event, for example, but should not be confused with the use of questioning to deepe n students’ understanding.      Discussion techniques   Effective teachers promote learni ng through discussion. A foundational skill that students learn through engaging in discussion is that of explaining and just ifying their reasoning and  conclusions, based on specific evidence. Teachers skilled in the use of questioning and discussion techn iques challenge students to examine their premises, to build a logical argument,  and to critique the arguments of others. Some teachers report, “We discussed x,” when what they mean is “I said x.” That is,  some teachers confuse discussion with explanation  of  content; as important as that is, it’s not discussion. Rather, in a true discussion a teacher poses a question and invites al l students’ views to be heard, enabling students to engage in  discussion directly with one another, not always mediated by the t eacher. Furthermore, in conducting discussions, skilled teachers build further questions on student responses and  insist that students examine their premises, build a logical argument, and critique the arguments of others.      Student participation   In some cla sses a few students tend to dominate the discussion; other students, recognizing this pattern, hold back their contributions.   The skilled teacher uses a range of  techniques to encourage all students to contribute to the discussion and enlists the assistanc e of students to ensure this outcome.    INDICATORS INCLUDE:      Questions of high cognitive challenge, formulated by both students and teacher      Questions with multiple correct answers or multiple approaches, even when there is a single correct response       Effective use of student responses and ideas      Discussion, with the teacher stepping out of the central, mediating role      Focus on the reasoning exhibited by students in discussion, both in give and take with the teacher and with their classmates      High levels o f student participation in discussion  

50     Component 3b: Using Questioning/Prompts and Discussion Techniques   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE EXAMPLES   4   The teacher uses a variety or series of questions  or prompts to challenge students cognitively,  advance high - level thinking and discourse, and  promote metacognition. Students formulate many  questions, initiate topics, challenge one another’s  thinking, and make unsolicited contributions.  Students themselves ensure that all voices are  heard in the disc ussion.      Students initiate higher - order questions.      The teacher builds on and uses student responses to  questions in order to deepen student understanding.      Students extend the discussion, enriching it.      Students invite comments from their classmates during  a  discussion and challenge one another’s thinking.      Virtually all students are engaged in the discussion.      A student asks, “How many ways are there to get this answer?”      A student says to a classmate, “I don’t think I agree with you on this,  because…”      A student   asks of other students, “Does anyone have another idea  how we might figure this out?”      A student asks, “What if…?”   3   While the teacher may use some low - level  questions, he poses questions designed to  promote student thinking and understanding. The  teacher   creates a genuine discussion among  students, providing adequate time for students to  respond and stepping aside when doing so is  appropriate. The teacher challenges students to  justify their thinking and successfully engages most  students in the discussio n, employing a range of  strategies to ensure that most students are heard.      The teacher uses open - ended questions, inviting  students to think and/or offer multiple possible  answers.      The teacher makes effective use of wait time.      Discussions enable students t o talk to one another  without ongoing mediation by the teacher.      The teacher calls on most students, even those who  don’t initially volunteer.       Many students actively engage in the discussion.      The teacher asks students to justify their reasoning,  and most s tudents attempt to do so.        The teacher asks, “What might have happened if the colonists had  not prevailed in the American war for independence?      The teacher uses the plural form in asking questions, such as “What  are some things you think might contribute t o _____?”      The teacher asks, “Maria, can you comment on Ian’s idea?” and  Maria responds directly to Ian.       The teacher poses a question, asking every student to write a brief  response and then share it with a partner, before inviting a few to  offer their ide as to the entire class.      The teacher asks students when they have formulated an answer to  the question “Why do you think Huck Finn did _____?” to find the  reason in the text and to explain their thinking to a neighbor.   2   The teacher’s questions lead  students through a  single path of inquiry, with answers seemingly  determined in advance. Alternatively, the teacher  attempts to ask some questions designed to  engage students in thinking, but only a few  students are involved. The teacher attempts to  engage   all students in the discussion, to encourage  them to respond to one another, and to explain  their thinking, with uneven results.      The teacher frames some questions designed to  promote student thinking, but many have a single  correct answer, and the teacher   calls on students  quickly.      The teacher invites students to respond directly to  one another’s ideas, but few students respond.      The teacher calls on many students, but only a small  number actually participate in the discussion.       The teacher asks students to   explain their reasoning,  but only some students attempt to do so.      Many questions are of the “recitation” type, such as “How many  members of the House of Representatives are there?”      The teacher asks, “Who has an idea about this?” The usual three  students  offer comments.      The teacher asks, “Maria, can you comment on Ian’s idea?” but Maria  does not respond or makes a comment directly to the teacher.      The teacher asks a student to explain his reasoning for why 13 is a  prime number but does not follow up when th e student falters   1   The teacher’s questions are of low cognitive  challenge, with single correct responses, and are  asked in rapid succession. Interaction between  teacher and students is predominantly recitation  style, with the teacher mediating all questi ons and  answers; the teacher accepts all contributions  without asking students to explain their reasoning.  Only a few students participate in the discussion.      Questions are rapid - fire and convergent, with a single  correct answer.      Questions do not invite  student thinking.      All discussion is between the teacher and students;  students are not invited to speak directly to one  another.      The teacher does not ask students to explain their  thinking.      Only a few students dominate the discussion.      All questions are of  the “recitation” type, such as “What is 3 x 4?”      The teacher asks a question for which the answer is on the board;  students respond by reading it.      The teacher calls only on students who have their hands up.      A student responds to a question with wrong inform ation, and the  teacher doesn’t follow up.          

51     DOMAIN 3: INSTRUCTION   Component 3c: Engaging Students in Learning   Student engagement in learning is the centerpiece of the Framework for Teaching; all other components contribute to it. When  students are  engaged in learning, they are not merely  “busy,” nor are they only “on task.” Rather, they are intellectually active in learning important and challenging content. Th e critical distinction between a classroom in which students are  compliant and busy, and o ne in which they are engaged, is that in the latter students are developing their understanding through what they do. That is , they are engaged in discussion,  debate, answering “what if?” questions, discovering patterns, and the like. They may be selecting   their work from a range of (teacher - arranged) choices, and making important contributions  to the intellectual life of the class. Such activities don’t typically consume an entire lesson, but they are essential compo nents of engagement.     A  lesson in which  students are engaged usually has a discernible structure: a beginning, a middle, and an end, with scaffolding provided by the   teacher or by the activities themselves.  Student tasks are organized to provide cognitive challenge, and then students are encoura ged to reflect on what they have done and what they have learned. That is, the lesson   has  closure,  in which teachers encourage students to derive the important learning from the learning tasks, from the discussion, or from w hat they have read. Critical que stions for an observer in  determining the degree of student engagement are “What are the students being asked to do? Does the learning task involve thi nking? Are students challenged to discern patterns or make  predictions?” If the answer to these questions   is that students are, for example, filling in blanks on a worksheet or performing a rote procedure, they are unlikely to be c ognitively engaged.     In observing a lesson, it is essential not only to watch the teacher but also to pay close attention to the s tudents and what they are doing. The best evidence for student engagement is  what students are saying and doing as a consequence of what the teacher does, or has done, or has planned. And while students   may be physically active (e.g., using manipulative ma terials  in mathematics or making a map in social studies), it is not essential that they be involved in a hands - on manner; it is, however, essential that they are challenged to be “minds - on.”   THE ELEMENTS OF COMPONENT 3C ARE:      Activities and assignments   The activities and assignments are the centerpiece of student engagement, since they determine what it is that students are a sked to do. Activities and assignments that  promote learning require student thinking that emphasizes depth over breadth and encour ages students to explain their thinking.      Grouping of students   How students are grouped for instruction (whole class, small groups, pairs, individuals) is one of the many decisions teacher s make every day. There are many options; students  of similar backgro und and skill may be clustered together, or the more advanced students may be spread around into the different groups. Altern atively, a teacher might permit  students to select their own groups, or they could be formed randomly. Note: Grouping of students i s an important element of 3c. However, because it is not possible to  ascertain the suitability of the grouping strategy for the lesson without fully knowing the teacher’s instructional purpose — which is not evident from a video alone — it is not  included in t he levels of performance for the Framework for Teaching Evaluation Instrument, 2013 Edition (Observable Components).      Instructional materials and resources   The instructional materials a teacher selects to use in the classroom can have an enormous impact on  students’ experience. Though some teachers are obliged to use a  school’s or district’s officially sanctioned materials, many teachers use these selectively or supplement them with others of   their choosing that are better suited to engaging  students in deep   learning — for example, the use of primary source materials in social studies.      Structure and pacing   No one, whether an adult or a student, likes to be either bored or rushed in completing a task. Keeping things moving, within   a well - defined structure, is on e of the marks of an  experienced teacher. And since much of student learning results from their reflection on what they have done, a well - designed lesson includes time for reflection and closure.   INDICATORS INCLUDE:      Student enthusiasm, interest,  thinking, problem solving, etc.      Learning tasks that require high - level student thinking and invite students to explain their thinking       Students highly motivated to work on all tasks and persistent even when the tasks are challenging      Students actively  “working,” rather than watching while their teacher “works”      Suitable pacing of the lesson: neither dragged out nor rushed, with time for closure and student reflection  

52     Component 3c: Engaging Students in Learning   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE  EXAMPLES   4   Virtually all students are intellectually engaged in challenging  content through well - designed learning tasks and activities  that require complex thinking by students. The teacher  provides suitable scaffolding and challenges students to  explain their think ing.  There is evidence of some student  initiation of inquiry and student contributions to the  exploration of important content; students may serve as  resources for one another. The lesson has a clearly defined  structure, and the pacing of the lesson provid es students  the time needed not only to intellectually engage with and  reflect upon their learning but also to consolidate their  understanding.      Virtually all students are intellectually engaged in the  lesson.      Lesson activities require high - level student th inking and  explanations of their thinking.      Students take initiative to adapt the lesson   by   (1)  modifying a learning task to make it more meaningful  or relevant to their needs, (2) suggesting modifications  to the grouping patterns used, and/or (3) suggestin g  modifications or additions to the materials being used.      Students have an opportunity for reflection and closure  on the lesson to consolidate their understanding.      Students are asked to write an essay in the style of  Hemmingway   and to describe which  aspects of his style they  have incorporated.      Students determine which of several tools — e.g., a  protractor, spreadsheet, or graphing calculator — would be  most suitable to solve a math problem.      A student asks whether they might remain in their small  groups to   complete another section of the activity, rather  than work independently.      Students identify or create their own learning materials.      Students summarize their learning from the lesson.   3   The learning tasks and activities are designed to challenge  student  thinking, inviting students to make their thinking  visible. This technique results in active intellectual  engagement by most students with important and  challenging content and with teacher scaffolding to  support that engagement The lesson has a clearly de fined  structure, and the pacing of the lesson is appropriate,  providing most students the time needed to be  intellectually engaged.      Most students are intellectually engaged in the lesson.      Most learning tasks have multiple correct responses or  approaches an d/or encourage higher - order thinking.      Students are invited to explain their thinking as part of  completing tasks.      Materials and resources require intellectual  engagement, as appropriate.      The pacing of the lesson provides students the  time  needed to be inte llectually engaged.      Five students (out of 27) have finished an assignment early  and begin talking among themselves; the teacher assigns a  follow - up activity.      Students are asked to formulate a hypothesis about what  might happen if the American voting system   allowed for the  direct election of presidents and to explain their reasoning.      Students are given a task to do independently, then to discuss  with a table group, followed by a reporting from each table.      Students are asked to create different representation s of a  large number using a variety of manipulative materials.      The lesson is neither rushed nor does it drag.   2   The learning tasks and activities require only minimal  thinking by students and little opportunity for them to  explain their thinking, allowing   most students to be  passive or merely compliant. The lesson has a  recognizable structure; however, the pacing of the lesson  may not provide students the time needed to be  intellectually engaged or may be so slow that many  students have a considerable amou nt of “down time.”      Some students are intellectually engaged in the lesson.      Learning tasks are a mix of those requiring thinking  and those requiring recall.      Student engagement with the content is largely passive;  the learning consists primarily of facts or  procedures.       Few of the materials and resources require student  thinking or ask students to explain their thinking.      The pacing of the lesson is uneven — suitable in parts  but rushed or dragging in others.      Students in only three of the five small groups are  figuring  out an answer to the assigned problem; the others seem to  be unsure how they should proceed.      Students are asked to fill in a worksheet, following an  established procedure.      There is a recognizable beginning, middle, and end to the  lesson.      The teach er lectures for 20 minutes and provides 15 minutes  for the students to write an essay; not all students are able  to complete it.   1   The learning tasks/activities, materials, and resources  require only rote responses, with only one approach  possible. The  lesson has no clearly defined structure, or  the pace of the lesson is too slow or rushed.      Few students are intellectually engaged in the lesson.      Learning tasks/activities and materials require only  recall or have a single correct response or method.      Instru ctional materials used are unsuitable to the  lesson and/or the students.      The lesson drags or is rushed.        Most students disregard the assignment given by the teacher;  it appears to be much too difficult for them.      Students fill out the lesson worksheet by co pying words  from the board.      Students are using math manipulative materials in a rote activity.      The teacher lectures for 45 minutes.      Most students don’t have time to complete the assignment;  the teacher moves on in the lesson.  

53     DOMAIN 3: INSTRUCTION   Component 3D: Using Assessment in Instruction   Assessment of student learning plays an important new role in teaching: no longer signaling the  end   of instruction, it is now recognized to be an integral  part   of instruction. While  assessment  of   learning has always been and will continue to be an important aspect of teaching (it’s important for teachers to know whether   students have learned what teachers  intend), assessment  for   learning has increasingly come to play an important role in classroom   practice. And in order to assess student learning for the purposes of instruction, teachers  must have a “finger on the pulse” of a lesson, monitoring student understanding and, where feedback is appropriate, offering  it to students.     A teacher’s actions i n monitoring student learning, while they may superficially look the same as those used in monitoring student behavior, have  a fundamentally different  purpose. When monitoring behavior, teachers are alert to students who may be passing notes or bothering t heir neighbors; when monitoring student learning, teachers look  carefully at what students are writing, or listen carefully to the questions students ask, in order to gauge whether they req uire additional activity or explanation to grasp the  content. In ea ch case, the teacher may be circulating in the room, but his/her purpose in doing do is quite different in the two situations .      Similarly, on the surface, questions asked of students for the purpose of monitoring learning are fundamentally different fro m  those used to build understanding; in the former, the  questions seek to reveal students’ misconceptions, whereas in the latter the questions are designed to explore relationships  or deepen understanding. Indeed, for the purpose of  monitoring, many teachers   create questions specifically to elicit the extent of student understanding and use additional techniques (such as exit ticke ts) to determine the degree of  understanding of every student in the class.   Teachers at high levels of performance in this  component, then, demonstrate the ability to encourage students and actually teach them  the necessary skills of monitoring their own learning against clear standards.     But as important as monitoring student learning and providing feedback to students are, h owever, they are greatly strengthened by a teacher’s skill in making mid - course  corrections when needed, seizing on a “teachable moment,” or enlisting students’ particular interests to enrich an explanatio n.   THE ELEMENTS OF COMPONENT 3D ARE:      Assessment  criteria   It is essential that students know the criteria for assessment. At its highest level, students themselves have had a hand in  articulating the criteria (for example, of a clear oral  presentation).      Monitoring of student learning   A teacher’s skill in   eliciting evidence of student understanding is one of the true marks of expertise. This is not a hit - or - miss effort, but is planned carefully in advance. Even  after planning carefully, however, a teacher must weave monitoring of student learning seamlessl y into the lesson, using a variety of techniques.      Feedback to students   Feedback on learning is an essential element of a rich instructional environment; without it, students are constantly guessin g at how they are doing and at how their work can be  improve d. Valuable feedback must be timely, constructive, and substantive and must provide students the guidance they need to improv e their performance.      Student self - assessment and monitoring of progress   The culmination of students’ assumption of responsibility  for their learning is when they monitor their own learning and take appropriate action. Of course, they can do these  things only if the criteria for learning are clear and if they have been taught the skills of checking their work against cle ar criteria.      L esson adjustment   Experienced teachers are able to make both minor and (at times) major adjustments to a lesson, or midcourse corrections. Such   adjustments depend on a teacher’s store of  alternate instructional strategies and the confidence to make a shift  when needed.   INDICATORS INCLUDE:      The teacher paying close attention to evidence of student understanding      The teacher posing specifically created questions to elicit evidence of student understanding      The teacher circulating to monitor student learning and   to offer feedback      Students assessing their own work against established criteria      The teacher adjusting instruction in response to evidence of student understanding (or lack of it)  

54     Component 3D: Using Assessment in Instruction   LEVEL     CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES   POSSIBLE EXAMPLES   4   Assessment is fully integrated into instruction,  through extensive use of formative assessment.  Students appear to be aware of, and there is some  evidence that they have contributed to, the  assessment criteria. Questions and  assessments  are used regularly to diagnose evidence of learning  by individual students. A variety of forms of  feedback, from both teacher and peers, is accurate  and specific and advances learning. Students self - assess and monitor their own progress. The  te acher successfully differentiates instruction to  address individual students’ misunderstandings.      Students indicate that they clearly understand the characteristics  of high - quality work, and there is evidence that students have  helped establish the evaluati on criteria.      The teacher is constantly “taking the pulse” of the class;  monitoring of student understanding is sophisticated and  continuous and makes use of strategies to elicit information about  individual student understanding.       Students monitor their ow n understanding, either on their own  initiative or as a result of tasks set by the teacher.      High - quality feedback comes from many sources, including  students; it is specific and focused on improvement.      The teacher’s adjustments to the lesson, when they are   needed,  are designed to assist individual students.      The teacher reminds students of the characteristics of  high - quality work, observing that the students themselves  helped develop them.      While students are working, the teacher circulates,  providing specifi c feedback to individual students.      The teacher uses popsicle sticks or exit tickets to elicit  evidence of individual student understanding.      Students offer feedback to their classmates on their work.      Students evaluate a piece of their writing against the  wr iting rubric and confer with the teacher about how it  could be improved.   3   Students appear to be aware of the assessment  criteria, and the teacher monitors student learning  for groups of students. Questions and assessments  are regularly used to diagnose  evidence of learning.  Teacher feedback to groups of students is accurate  and specific; some students engage in self - assessment. If impromptu measures are needed, the  teacher makes a minor adjustment to the lesson  and does so smoothly.      The teacher makes the   standards of high - quality work clear to  students.      The teacher elicits evidence of student understanding.       Students are invited to assess their own work and make  improvements; most of them do so.       Feedback includes specific and timely guidance at least for   groups of students.      When improvising becomes necessary, the teacher makes  adjustments to the lesson.      The teacher circulates during small - group or independent  work, offering suggestions to students.      The teacher uses specifically formulated questions to  eli cit evidence of student understanding.       The teacher asks students to look over their papers to  correct their errors; most of them engage in this task.   2   Students appear to be only partially aware of the  assessment criteria, and the teacher monitors  student learning for the class as a whole.  Questions and assessments are rarely used to  diagnose evidence of learning. Feedback to  students is general, and few students assess their  own work. Adjustment of the lesson in response  to assessment is minimal or   ineffective.      There is little evidence that the students understand how their  work will be evaluated.      The teacher monitors understanding through a single method, or  without eliciting evidence of understanding from students.      Feedback to students is vague an d not oriented toward future  improvement of work.      The teacher makes only minor attempts to engage students in  self -   or peer assessment.       The teacher’s attempts to adjust the lesson are partially  successful.      The teacher asks, “Does anyone have a question?      When a student completes a problem on the board, the  teacher corrects the student’s work without explaining  why.      The teacher says, “Good job, everyone.”       The teacher, after receiving a correct response from one  student, continues without ascertaining wheth er other  students understand the concept.      The students receive their tests back; each one is simply  marked with a letter grade at the top.   1   Students do not appear to be aware of the  assessment criteria, and there is little or no  monitoring of student  learning; feedback is absent,  or of poor quality.  Students do not engage in self -   or peer assessment, and the teacher makes no  attempt to adjust the lesson even when students  don’t understand the content.      The teacher gives no indication of what high - quali ty work looks  like.      The teacher makes no effort to determine whether students  understand the lesson.      Students receive no feedback, or feedback is global or directed to  only one student.       The teacher does not ask students to evaluate their own or  classmates ’ work.      The teacher makes no attempt to adjust the lesson in response to  student confusion.      A student asks, “How is this assignment going to be graded?”       A student asks, “Is this the right way to solve this problem?”  but receives no information from the te acher.      The teacher forges ahead with a presentation without  checking for understanding.      After the students present their research on globalization,  the teacher tells them their letter grade; when students ask  how the teacher arrived at the grade, he respon ds, “After all  these years in education, I just know what grade to give.”

Record keeping should include artifacts of student work, formative and  summative checks on the students’ progress, grade book s, records, and non - instructional interactions having to do with student behavior or social skills. These data must be collected and tracked in a   systematic way, making it easy to find and communicate student progress to other colleagues, parents, or the s tudents themselves.
