# Student Learning Goals Model

## Overview

The student learning goals model provides a detailed and flexible plan for how student learning will be measured and pursued. The initial learning goal is established and the learning expectations are compared to the final student data. Both long- and short-term cycles are options through this model.

### Distinguishing Feature

Teachers are provided with flexibility to measure a long-term student learning goal while making adjustments to instruction and the expectations based on data collected from shorter cycles of instruction.
