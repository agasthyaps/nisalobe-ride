# One Potential Scenario for the Student Learning Goal Model

## Beginning of Year Assessment and Planning

At the beginning of the school year, an elementary teacher reviews her students' previous year's data records in addition to the common beginning-of-year assessments and other observations. After an individual review of her students' data, she determines that reading represents a wide number of ability levels, as expected. Before determining how she will support her students in her class through the planned curriculum, she decides to have a conversation with her teaching team (or coach, colleague, administrator, etc.) about common findings from students' BOY data at that grade level. 

This conversation supports some of her initial conclusions. She will be evaluated through the student learning goal model as an alternative to the original SLO process. She chooses to use reading as a prioritized content area and to focus on a subset of her class who are non-native speakers, identified as ELLs, and have yet to meet grade-level expectations.

## Selecting Assessments and Setting Goals

With reading as a focus for the year, she decides that she will use her common reading assessment, the DRA, as well as running records to measure her students' progress for the year. Her SLG is designed in a way that she is striving to close the achievement gap with her ELL students that are below grade-level expectations, while monitoring all students' progress. 

Early in the year, the teacher meets with her evaluator as part of the regular evaluation cycle to discuss professional practice, professional responsibilities, and student learning. This discussion will include learning expectations for her students to meet the individual needs of each student over the course of the cycle of instruction. The evaluator explains to the teacher that the learning expectations can be adjusted based on smaller cycles of instruction for a subset of students. 

With this in mind, the teacher sees an opportunity to use the first unit of study as a shorter measure of her proposed long-term goal. The evaluator and teacher agree on the year-long goal, which will be divided into smaller cycles of instruction.

## Ongoing Data Collection and Adjustment

Throughout her first reading units as planned within the curriculum, she collects and reflects upon her students' work and adjusts her instructional practice to meet her students' various needs in reading. She provides on-going feedback, both written and verbal, to her students so that they have an opportunity to reflect on and improve their skills in literacy. 

After reviewing the new 3E/3.5 rubric, she sees that including student reflections on their own learning can lead her to a rating of a 3 or a 4. Through her whole-class data analysis, she determines that adjustments are needed because some of her ELL students met the initial goal, while others in the class will require more intensive support for the upcoming unit.

## Mid-Year Check-In and Learning Expectation Revision

Later, at her next check-in with her evaluator, she highlights the progress that all students have made, but notes that her initial learning expectations need to be adjusted based on the data from her shorter units of study in reading. The evaluator and the teacher reflected on the whole-class data sheets to identify trends and reflect on instructional methods that should be sustained, eliminated, and improved upon. 

They both agree that the teacher will adjust the learning expectations based on the current needs in her class with a continued focus on the subset of ELL students. As the year progresses, the teacher continues to adjust the targeted group and the learning expectations as necessary.

## End-of-Year Reflection and Evaluation

As part of her preparation for her end-of-year conference, she analyzes the data for her students' DRA scores, particularly the subset of ELL students. Recognizing that the final rating is made by the evaluator, the teacher and evaluator reflect on professional practice and responsibilities, as well as student learning using the approved evaluation system rubric(s). 

This leads to a discussion with her evaluator about the usefulness of shifting the learning expectations as each shorter cycle data informed her instructional decisions and planning. They also discuss how the data align with evidence of instructional practices in order to determine how she will approach reading instruction in the coming year, as well as opportunities for professional learning.
